## Summary
- 40-year-old man with advanced HIV (CD4 count 50 cells/mm³), poor ART compliance
- Presents with subacute onset headaches, confusion, and personality changes, without fever or neck stiffness
- MRI: multiple ring-enhancing brain lesions
- Highly consistent with HIV-associated cerebral toxoplasmosis

## Problems and Assessments

1. Cerebral toxoplasmosis (probable)
   - HIV with severe immunosuppression and classic imaging/clinical features strongly suggest cerebral toxoplasmosis; delay in treatment risks severe morbidity/mortality [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).

2. Advanced HIV/immunosuppression
   - CD4 <100, at very high risk for opportunistic infections, requires rapid re-initiation of ART but with timing considerations [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).

3. Long-term prophylaxis/relapse prevention
   - High relapse rate if secondary prophylaxis is not instituted even after symptom resolution [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).

4. Risk of other CNS pathology (Possible)
   - CNS lymphoma and other opportunistic infections can mimic toxoplasmosis; nonresponse to empiric therapy requires further evaluation [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- Toxoplasma serology (IgG): Supports diagnosis if positive in context of compatible clinical/imaging features [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
- Repeat brain MRI/CT in 10–14 days: To assess radiologic response to therapy; lack of improvement should prompt reconsideration of diagnosis, e.g. lymphoma, abscess [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
- Consider lumbar puncture if diagnosis uncertain or if there are features atypical for toxoplasmosis (e.g., rapid progression, no radiologic response) [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
- If still uncertain after 2 weeks or clinical/radiologic deterioration, consider brain biopsy [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
- Baseline laboratory and monitoring: FBC, renal/liver function, electrolytes, particularly with pyrimethamine therapy [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Begin empiric anti-toxoplasmosis treatment:
    - 1st line: Pyrimethamine + sulfadiazine + leucovorin for 6 weeks (induction); adjust for renal/hepatic dysfunction [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
    - If sulfa allergy/intolerance: Pyrimethamine + clindamycin + leucovorin [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
    - Alternative: TMP-SMX (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, co-trimoxazole) high dose can be considered if standard agents unavailable/tolerated [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
    - Leucovorin (folinic acid) mandatory with pyrimethamine to prevent bone marrow toxicity [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
- Monitor for response (clinical and radiologic) and adverse drug effects [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
- Commence ART (antiretroviral therapy) but **delay initiation until 2 weeks after starting anti-toxoplasmosis therapy** to reduce risk of IRIS (immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome) [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
- Start maintenance (secondary prophylaxis) after initial response: Pyrimethamine + sulfadiazine + leucovorin, until CD4 >200 for >6 months on ART [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
- Anticonvulsant therapy if seizures occur [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
- Supportive care: hydration, electrolyte correction, manage increased intracranial pressure if present [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).

- Neurology: For ongoing neurocognitive monitoring, or if seizures/complications develop [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
- Pharmacy: To assist drug interaction checks and compliance support, especially with ART and complex anti-toxoplasma regimens [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Lifelong secondary prophylaxis unless immune reconstitution achieved [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
- Educate patient: Avoid raw/undercooked meat, potential sources of Toxoplasma (cat litter, contaminated soil); hand hygiene [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
- Adherence counseling: ART and prophylaxis compliance are critical to prevent relapse and other opportunistic infections [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).

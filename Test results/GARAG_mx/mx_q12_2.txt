## Summary
- 35F presents with pleuritic chest pain, dyspnoea, tachycardia (HR 112), tachypnoea (RR 22), hypoxaemia (SpO₂ 90%) after recent long-haul flight.
- CXR clear; ECG shows sinus tachycardia; D-dimer elevated.
- Clinical picture is highly suspicious for acute pulmonary embolism (PE) with possible mild hypoxaemia but no clinical shock at present.

## Problems and Assessments

1. Acute Pulmonary Embolism (Possible)
   - Highly likely given recent immobility (flight), pleuritic pain, breathlessness, tachycardia, hypoxaemia, and elevated D-dimer; CXR excludes other acute chest pathologies[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/42576).

2. Hypoxaemia
   - SpO₂ 90% indicates clinically significant impairment of gas exchange, commonly seen in PE due to ventilation/perfusion mismatch[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/42576).

3. Anxiety (secondary)
   - Patient reported as anxious, which may exacerbate cardiorespiratory distress.

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) to confirm diagnosis of PE; gold standard in haemodynamically stable patients as per guideline recommendations[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19382).
- Consider bedside echocardiography if clinical instability develops; can assess for right ventricular strain suggesting massive/submassive PE[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/42576).
- Baseline bloods: FBC, U&E, LFTs, clotting, troponin, BNP; assess for renal function (prior to contrast), rule out cardiac injury, guide anticoagulation[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19382).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Commence supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO₂ >94% (unless contraindicated)[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19382).
- Immediate therapeutic anticoagulation unless contraindicated (e.g., active bleeding, very high bleeding risk): low molecular weight heparin (e.g., enoxaparin SC), or unfractionated heparin IV if renal impairment/severe PE and potential for thrombolysis.
- In the event of haemodynamic instability (e.g., hypotension, shock): initiate thrombolytic therapy as per protocol—immediate indication in massive PE with shock[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19382).
- Monitor for signs of clinical deterioration (hypotension, increasing tachycardia, decreased consciousness).
- Analgesia as required for pain control, using paracetamol (acetaminophen) or opioid if severe.

**Referrals:**
- Refer to respiratory or acute medical team for specialist input and ongoing monitoring/treatment.
- Escalate to intensive care unit (ICU) if any signs of cardiorespiratory compromise or if advanced therapies (e.g., thrombolysis) are indicated.

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Once stable and on long-term anticoagulation, provide advice regarding risk factor modification: maintain mobility, avoidance of dehydration on future long travel.
- Assess for underlying thrombophilia or malignancy if unprovoked or recurrent PE.

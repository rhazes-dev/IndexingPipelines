## Summary
- 35F presenting with fatigue, bloating, loose stools.
- Exam: pallor, mild abdominal distension.
- Labs: microcytic anemia (Hb 9.8, MCV 70), low ferritin.
- Positive anti-TTG IgA; negative stool cultures.
- Diagnostic impression: Celiac disease with iron deficiency anaemia.

## Problems and Assessments

1. Newly Diagnosed Celiac Disease
   - Autoimmune enteropathy, confirmed by anti-TTG positivity and consistent symptoms; likely causing malabsorption and anemia [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/33958).

2. Iron Deficiency Anaemia
   - Microcytic anemia and low ferritin due to malabsorption from celiac enteropathy [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/33958).

3. (Possible) Other Micronutrient Deficiencies
   - At risk for further deficiencies (calcium, folate, B12) due to ongoing malabsorption [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/24657).

4. Symptomatic Malabsorption (fatigue, bloating, loose stools)
   - Symptoms consistent with impaired nutrient absorption, requiring symptomatic management and confirmatory assessment [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/33958).

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- Duodenal biopsy to confirm villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia, per guidelines—required for diagnosis of celiac disease [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/33958).
- Screen for other autoimmune conditions (e.g., thyroid function tests), as associated with celiac disease [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/33958).
- Assess micronutrient levels (iron studies already done; add calcium, vitamin D, folate, B12), as celiac results in broad malabsorption [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/24657).
- Bone density evaluation (DEXA scan) if risk factors for osteopenia/osteoporosis or longstanding celiac disease [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/33958).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Initiate strict lifelong gluten-free diet (GFD)—the cornerstone of therapy for celiac disease; exclude all wheat, rye, barley [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/33958), [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/24657).
- Oral iron supplementation to correct deficiency, monitor response and ferritin levels [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/33958).
- Supplement other identified deficiencies (calcium, vitamin D, folate, B12) according to laboratory findings [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/24657).
- Symptomatic therapies for diarrhea and bloating can be considered (e.g., loperamide short-term); but focus on correcting underlying cause [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/24657).
- Supportive dietary advice to optimize nutritional intake with exclusion diet; recommend referral to dietitian.
- Regular follow-up to monitor for clinical and laboratory response (symptoms, hemoglobin, serology, micronutrients).

**Referrals:**
- Refer to gastroenterology for biopsy confirmation, GFD education, and management of refractory symptoms/complications; also for screening family members if indicated [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/33958).
- Refer to dietitian for detailed advice on gluten-free nutrition and adequate replacement of all micronutrients [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/33958).

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Education on lifelong gluten-free diet adherence, label reading, and cross-contamination risk [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/33958).
- Advise on bone health (weight-bearing exercise, calcium and vitamin D intake) due to increased risk of osteoporosis [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/33958).
- Discuss family member screening if first-degree relatives have symptoms or autoimmune history [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/33958).

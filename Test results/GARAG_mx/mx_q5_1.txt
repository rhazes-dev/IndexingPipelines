## Summary
- 6-year-old child with 1-week history of progressive, predominantly morning periorbital swelling and lower limb pitting oedema.
- Marked proteinuria (>3.5g/day), hypoalbuminaemia (20 g/L), hyperlipidaemia—classic nephrotic syndrome features.
- Renal function and blood pressure normal.
- Age, presentation and labs strongly suggest minimal change disease (MCD), the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in this age group.

## Problems and Assessments

1. Nephrotic Syndrome (Probable Minimal Change Disease)
   - Typical age group, clinical features and labs including heavy proteinuria, low albumin, hyperlipidaemia, and oedema point to MCD as the cause of idiopathic nephrotic syndrome in this child[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25173),[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25173).

2. Oedema/Fluid Overload
   - Prominent periorbital and peripheral oedema, risk of further complications (ascites, effusions)[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25707).

3. Infection Risk
   - Nephrotic syndrome is associated with increased risk of infection due to urinary protein loss (particularly immunoglobulins)[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25173).

4. Risk of Relapse and Corticosteroid Adverse Effects
   - High relapse rate in children with MCD, potential for steroid dependence/resistance and associated adverse effects[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25173),[4](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25713).

5. Thromboembolic Risk
   - Hyperlipidaemia and hypoalbuminaemia contribute to increased risk[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25707).

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- Baseline investigations (if not already performed):
    - Urinalysis and spot or 24-hour urine protein quantitation to confirm nephrotic-range proteinuria and monitor response[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25173).
    - Complete metabolic panel: monitor albumin, total protein, renal function, calcium[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25173).
    - Lipid profile: assess baseline hyperlipidaemia, monitor for improvement with therapy[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25173).
    - Complete blood count: assess for hemoconcentration and increased platelets (thrombocytosis)[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25173).
- Serologies to rule out secondary causes:
    - ANA, hepatitis B/C, HIV testing, complement levels, syphilis serology as clinically appropriate[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25173),[4](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25713).
- Renal biopsy is **not** routinely indicated in children with typical idiopathic features, unless atypical features present: age <1 or >12 years, gross hematuria, marked hypertension, abnormal renal function, hypocomplementemia, steroid resistance, or secondary cause suspicion[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25173),[4](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25713).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Corticosteroid therapy (First line for idiopathic nephrotic syndrome/MCD in children):
   - Prednisolone 2 mg/kg/day (max 60 mg) for 4 weeks, then reduce/taper per guideline and clinical response—majority will achieve remission[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25173),[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25173),[4](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25713).
   - Monitor for steroid side effects (growth, glucose, BP, behaviour).
- Manage oedema:
   - Sodium restriction and fluid management as appropriate for volume status[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25173).
   - Diuretics (e.g., furosemide) for symptomatic or severe oedema; consider albumin infusion only for severe hypoalbuminaemia with symptomatic fluid overload resistant to standard measures[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25173).
- Infection prophylaxis:
   - Early treatment of infections; consider pneumococcal vaccination and routine immunizations if not up to date[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25173).
- Thrombosis prevention:
   - Assess individual risk; usual prophylaxis not recommended unless additional risk factors present (e.g., severe hypoalbuminaemia, immobilization)[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25707).
- Frequent relapsers/steroid-dependent/steroid-resistant:
   - Immunosuppressive agents (cyclophosphamide, calcineurin inhibitors, mycophenolate mofetil, rituximab) based on relapse frequency, side-effect profiles, clinician and family discussion[4](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25713).
- Monitor:
   - Regular clinical review of weight, BP, urine protein, renal function, lipid profile and adverse effects during and after treatment[4](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25713).

**Referrals:**
- Paediatric nephrology referral for diagnosis confirmation, management guidance, especially if atypical features, steroid resistance, frequent/worrisome relapses, or complications arise[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25173),[4](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25713).

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Salt restriction and encourage a balanced diet appropriate to age and renal status[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25173).
- Encourage adherence to prescribed medications and monitoring, with education for family on disease course, signs of complications, and infection prevention[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25173),[4](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25713).

## Summary
- 24-year-old woman with fatigue, pallor, exertional SOB, and heavy menstrual bleeding (7 days/cycle).
- Exam: conjunctival pallor.
- Labs: Hb 7.5 g/dL, MCV 70 fL, markedly decreased ferritin.
- PBS: hypochromic microcytic RBCs.
- Diagnosis: Severe iron deficiency anaemia secondary to chronic heavy menstrual blood loss.

## Problems and Assessments

1. Iron Deficiency Anemia (secondary to menorrhagia)
   - Severe microcytic, hypochromic anemia with low ferritin and PBS findings highly suggest iron deficiency due to chronic blood loss from heavy menstruation[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25104).
   
2. Heavy Menstrual Bleeding (menorrhagia)
   - Ongoing blood loss is the primary driver of iron deficiency. Needs investigation for underlying gynecologic cause and management to prevent recurrence[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17532).

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- Pelvic ultrasound to investigate for anatomic causes of menorrhagia (e.g., fibroids, polyps)[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17532).
- Thyroid function tests and coagulation profile to assess for other contributors to abnormal uterine bleeding[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17532).
- Repeat CBC and reticulocyte count after 2–4 weeks of iron therapy to monitor response and rule out other causes if inadequate response is seen[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25104).
- Consider endometrial sampling if indicated by clinical suspicion (age, risk factors; not universally needed).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Initiate oral iron replacement: Ferrous sulfate 325 mg PO TID (or maximum tolerated dose) as first-line therapy; usually takes effect in 3 weeks with full response by 2 months[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25104).
  - Gradually increase dose to improve tolerance; monitor for GI side effects (nausea, constipation)[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25104).
- Parenteral iron (e.g., IV iron sucrose/ferric carboxymaltose) if: oral intolerance, malabsorption, or ongoing bleeding prevents response[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25104).
- Treat anemia acutely if hemodynamically unstable, or if cardiovascular compromise present (e.g., transfusion for Hb <7 or symptomatic)[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25104).
- Manage heavy menses: trial of medical therapy (e.g., combined oral contraceptive pill, tranexamic acid, NSAIDs) as appropriate for symptom control and bleeding reduction—coordinate with gynaecology team[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17532).
- Address underlying gynecologic pathology if identified.

**Referrals:**
- Gynecology for assessment and definitive management of menorrhagia (e.g., fibroids, endometrial pathology, hormonal options, surgical management if indicated)[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17532).
- Hematology referral only if anemia does not respond to iron after 4–8 weeks or if diagnosis unclear[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25104).

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Advise a diet rich in iron (red meats, leafy green vegetables, beans); vitamin C intake can aid iron absorption[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17532).
- Counsel about the importance of adherence to iron therapy and regular follow-up for monitoring.
- Women of childbearing age require close monitoring for anemia; recommend periodic CBC at least annually if risks persist[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17532).
- Educate about avoiding NSAIDs unless medically indicated, as they may exacerbate bleeding.

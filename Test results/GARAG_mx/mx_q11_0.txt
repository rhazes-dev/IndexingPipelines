## Summary
- 40-year-old male with 3 days of progressive bilateral lower limb weakness following diarrhoea 2 weeks ago.
- Neurological exam: flaccid weakness (power 3/5), absent reflexes in legs, reduced tone, preserved sensation, downgoing plantars.
- No upper motor neuron signs or sensory level.
- Clinical scenario suggestive of an acute peripheral neuropathy, most likely Guillain-Barre Syndrome (GBS).

## Problems and Assessments

1. Acute Flaccid Paralysis (Possible Guillain-Barre Syndrome)
   - Subacute symmetrical lower limb weakness, areflexia, hypotonia, and recent diarrhoeal illness are typical features of GBS, usually post-infectious; sensory function intact, consistent with the most common GBS presentations [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28765) [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).

2. Risk of Respiratory Compromise
   - GBS may progress rapidly and cause respiratory failure due to weakness of respiratory muscles; needs close monitoring [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).

3. Autonomic Dysfunction (Possible)
   - GBS can cause autonomic instability (arrhythmias, blood pressure fluctuations), which can be life-threatening and often warrants close surveillance [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).

4. Potential Complications (Deep vein thrombosis, infection, pressure injury)
   - Immobility due to weakness places the patient at elevated risk for bedsores, VTE, and secondary infection.

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- Lumbar puncture for CSF analysis: look for albuminocytologic dissociation (raised protein, normal WBC). Classically present in >80% of cases at 2 weeks; absence does not exclude GBS [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).
- Nerve conduction studies/EMG: to confirm demyelinating polyradiculoneuropathy, differentiate GBS from mimics [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28765).
- Serial spirometry (e.g., negative inspiratory force, vital capacity): monitor for impending respiratory failure, as GBS may progress suddenly to respiratory muscle involvement [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).
- Basic bloods: FBC, renal function, LFTs, CRP, blood cultures as per clinical context.
- Consider additional tests to exclude mimics if atypical features present (e.g., HIV serology, MRI spine if concern for myelopathy or to exclude compressive causes) [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- First-line: IV immunoglobulin (IVIG) 2 g/kg over 5 days or plasma exchange (5 exchanges over 2 weeks); both equally effective and superior to steroids or supportive care alone if administered within 4 weeks of onset [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).
- Supportive: Admit for close monitoring, especially for respiratory muscle strength and autonomic symptoms [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).
  - Regular monitoring of respiratory function for risk of ventilatory failure; early intubation if declining NIF/vital capacity.
  - Strict pressure area care, DVT prophylaxis if not contraindicated (e.g., LMWH—enoxaparin SC/heparin).
  - Catheter care and infection prevention.
  - Physical therapy and rehabilitation to maintain mobility and prevent contractures.
- Avoid steroids (oral prednisone or IV methylprednisolone), as they do not improve GBS outcomes and can increase risk of complications [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).

**Referrals:**
- Neurology—urgent referral for diagnosis confirmation, consideration of plasma exchange/IVIG, and ongoing management [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).
- Intensive Care—if respiratory function deteriorates or autonomic instability develops.
- Physiotherapy and rehabilitation for ongoing care after acute phase.

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Patient/family counselling regarding disease course, expected recovery, possible relapses, and rehabilitation.
- Early mobilisation and physiotherapy initiation once stable to reduce long-term disability.

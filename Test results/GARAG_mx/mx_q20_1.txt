## Summary
- 62-year-old man with cough, haemoptysis, weight loss, arthralgia, saddle-nose deformity, and purpuric rash.
- CXR: cavitating lung lesions.
- Renal impairment (creatinine 180 μmol/L).
- Clinical picture highly suggestive of Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA, formerly known as Wegener’s granulomatosis) with respiratory, ENT, skin, joint, and renal manifestations.

## Problems and Assessments

1. Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) (Possible)
   - Strongly suspected based on upper and lower respiratory tract involvement (saddle nose, cough, cavitating lesions, haemoptysis), skin purpura, arthralgia, and rapidly progressive renal impairment, fitting classic multisystem involvement of GPA [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).
   - Finding of saddle-nose deformity is virtually pathognomonic for GPA among vasculitides [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717), [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/76416).
   - CXR: Cavitating lung lesions support pulmonary granulomatous vasculitis [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/76416).
   - Renal impairment may indicate rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).
   - Purpuric rash suggests small-vessel vasculitis skin involvement [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).

2. Acute kidney injury/rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN)
   - Significantly elevated creatinine; could rapidly worsen without prompt therapy.
   - Likely secondary to pauci-immune crescentic glomerulonephritis in vasculitis [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).

3. Risk of life-threatening pulmonary haemorrhage
   - Haemoptysis and pulmonary lesions raise concern for alveolar haemorrhage, a severe GPA complication [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).

4. Multisystem involvement due to vasculitis (skin, joints)
   - Arthralgia and purpuric rash indicate active, systemic vasculitic process [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- Urgent ANCA panel (PR3/c-ANCA, MPO/p-ANCA): To confirm diagnosis and prognostic subtyping [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717), [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/76416).
- Renal function, urine microscopy for active sediment: To monitor progression and look for red cell casts [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).
- Urine protein:creatinine ratio: Quantification of renal involvement.
- Serum anti-GBM antibody: Exclude dual antibody disease ('double-positive') [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717), [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/76416).
- Full blood count, CRP/ESR: Assess for systemic inflammation and possible anaemia.
- Coagulation profile and group & save: Baseline and in readiness for possible plasma exchange.
- Infectious screening (Hepatitis B, C, HIV, TB): Prior to immunosuppressive therapy.
- CXR/CT chest (if not already done): To define extent of pulmonary involvement and rule out infection/mimics.
- Renal biopsy: To confirm pauci-immune necrotising crescentic glomerulonephritis if diagnosis remains uncertain [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).
- Consider tissue biopsy (e.g., nasal, skin, or lung): Diagnostic confirmation if available/feasible [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/76416).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Immediate initiation of high-dose corticosteroids: IV methylprednisolone 500-1000 mg daily for 3 days (induction), then oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day, max 60-80 mg) [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717), [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/76416).
- Add cyclophosphamide IV (preferred for severe/organ-threatening disease) or oral—dosing per protocol and renal function [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).
  - Alternative: Rituximab IV, especially in those with contraindications to cyclophosphamide or fertility concerns [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717), [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/76416).
- If life-threatening pulmonary haemorrhage or rapidly progressive renal failure: Consider plasma exchange ('PLEX'), especially if anti-GBM antibody-positive or “double-positive” [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717), [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/76416).
- Supportive management: Strict fluid balance, avoid nephrotoxins, monitor and manage electrolyte disturbances.
- Infection prophylaxis: Pneumocystis jirovecii (PJP) prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) while immunosuppressed [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).
- Blood pressure control: Consider ACE inhibitor unless contraindicated.
- DVT prophylaxis, early physiotherapy, and prevention of steroid-induced osteoporosis.

**Referrals:**
- Urgent nephrology: For vasculitis management, consideration of biopsy, and ongoing renal support.
- Urgent rheumatology/immunology: Clarification of systemic disease management, protocolised immunosuppression.
- ENT, pulmonology: For assessment and management of airway, sinus, and cavitary lesions as needed.

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Smoking cessation counselling: Smoking may increase relapse risk and complicate disease course [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).
- Immunisations: Update as appropriate (pneumococcus, influenza, varicella zoster) prior to immunosuppression, if possible.

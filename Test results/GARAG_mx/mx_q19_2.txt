## Summary
- 39-year-old woman developed amenorrhoea, cold intolerance, and weight gain 6 months after a complicated post-partum haemorrhage.
- Biochemistry: Low TSH, low T4, mildly elevated prolactin.
- Clinical context and findings are highly suggestive of Sheehan syndrome (post-partum hypopituitarism) with resultant pan- or partial hypopituitarism, specifically secondary hypothyroidism, hypogonadism, and hyperprolactinaemia.

## Problems and Assessments

1. Sheehan Syndrome (Post-partum Hypopituitarism)
   - The patient has classic features: onset following significant post-partum haemorrhage, amenorrhoea, symptoms of hypothyroidism, and biochemistry indicating secondary hypothyroidism and hyperprolactinaemia. Sheehan syndrome may present months to years later and presents with symptoms of hormone deficiencies[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28964).

2. Secondary hypothyroidism and hypogonadism due to pituitary insufficiency
   - Laboratory findings of low T4 with inappropriately low TSH indicate central (secondary) hypothyroidism. Amenorrhoea and symptoms of hypogonadism are likely related to gonadotropin deficiency[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28964).

3. Potential secondary adrenal insufficiency (Possible)
   - ACTH/cortisol status not given, but this is a life-threatening deficit and must be evaluated in all patients with panhypopituitarism[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28964).

4. Mildly elevated prolactin
   - Reflects loss of dopamine inhibition from hypothalamic-pituitary disruption; partial lactotroph function may persist, but agalactorrhea is common in Sheehan syndrome[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/692).

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- Assess morning (8am) cortisol and ACTH: To evaluate for secondary adrenal insufficiency, which is critical to identify prior to commencing thyroid hormone replacement as it may trigger adrenal crisis if present[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28964).
- Gonadotropins (LH, FSH), estradiol: To determine degree of hypogonadism and pituitary dysfunction[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28964).
- Full anterior pituitary screen: Including IGF-1 or GH as indicated, as growth hormone is often affected[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28964).
- Basic metabolic panel Â± fasting glucose, electrolytes, CBC: To look for other features of panhypopituitarism, e.g., anemia, hyponatremia, hypoglycemia[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28964).
- MRI pituitary: To assess pituitary size and morphology, look for atrophy or empty sella, exclude other structural lesions[4](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28964).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Commence hydrocortisone (or equivalent glucocorticoid replacement) if adrenal insufficiency is confirmed or suspected, before any thyroid replacement to avoid precipitating adrenal crisis[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28964).
- Start levothyroxine (thyroxine) once adrenal axis is secured, titrate to clinical effect and normal free T4 (do not use TSH to guide replacement due to central hypothyroidism)[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28964).
- Oestrogen-progestin replacement if uterus present (or oestrogen alone if uterus absent): To address hypogonadism, amenorrhoea, and reduce osteoporosis risk. Consider risks and benefits individually (e.g., VTE/cancer risks)[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28964).
- If GH deficiency confirmed and patient is symptomatic or young, consider growth hormone replacement under specialized guidance[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28964).
- Manage any additional pituitary hormone deficiencies as indicated.
- Patient education: Lifelong hormone replacement is required. Advise about sick-day rules (stress dosing steroids), compliance, and symptoms that require urgent medical attention[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28964).

**Referrals:**
- Endocrinology: Urgent referral for confirmation of diagnosis, dynamic endocrine testing, development of a tailored lifelong hormone replacement, and monitoring plan. Endocrinologist input is required for hormone titration and long-term management[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28964).

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Medical alert bracelet/identification to alert healthcare providers to steroid dependence and pituitary insufficiency[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28964).
- Education on infection/illness-related stress-dose steroid escalation[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28964).
- Smoking cessation, exercise, calcium/vitamin D supplementation where indicated, and bone density monitoring to reduce long-term osteoporosis risk.
- Lifelong regular follow-up for adjustment of hormone therapy and surveillance for complications[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28964).

## Summary
- 35-year-old woman presents with bloating, fatigue, loose stools.
- Examination: pallor, mild abdominal distension.
- Laboratory findings: microcytic anemia (Hb 9.8, MCV 70), low ferritin, anti-TTG IgA positive.
- Negative stool cultures.
- Likely diagnosis: celiac disease with resultant iron deficiency anemia and malabsorption.

## Problems and Assessments

1. Celiac Disease
   - Strongly suggested by loose stools, bloating, positive anti-TTG IgA, and iron deficiency anemia with low ferritin. Classic findings of malabsorption in an adult woman. Likely underlying cause of current symptoms and nutrient deficiencies [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/812).

2. Iron Deficiency Anemia (secondary to malabsorption)
   - Microcytic anemia with low ferritin. Malabsorption from celiac disease is a common cause of iron deficiency in adults [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/812).

3. Ongoing Malabsorption
   - Symptoms (fatigue, loose stools, bloating, abdominal distension) and lab findings (anemia) point to generalized malabsorption, with risk of further deficiencies (e.g., folate, B12, fat-soluble vitamins) [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/812).

4. Nutritional and Lifestyle Risk
   - Risk for osteoporosis (secondary to calcium/vitamin D malabsorption), additional micronutrient deficiencies, and chronic disease complications [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/812).

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- Upper GI endoscopy with duodenal biopsies to confirm celiac disease diagnosis and assess degree of mucosal damage [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/812).
- Screen for additional deficiencies: folate, B12, calcium, vitamin D, magnesium, and fat-soluble vitamins (A, E, K) as per malabsorption workup [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/812).
- Consider DEXA scan for bone mineral density to screen for osteoporosis (if diagnosis of celiac is confirmed) [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/812).
- Repeat iron studies after initial treatment to monitor response.
- Coeliac serology (anti-TTG IgA previously done; consider total IgA to exclude selective IgA deficiency) [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/812).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Initiate lifelong strict gluten-free diet (GFD), with referral to a dietitian experienced in coeliac disease for education and support [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/812).
- Oral iron supplementation (ferrous sulfate or equivalent) for iron deficiency anemia, monitoring for GI side effects and response [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/812).
- Supplement additional micronutrient deficiencies as needed based on laboratory evaluation (e.g., folic acid, B12, calcium, vitamin D).
- Monitor for symptom improvement and repeat serology after 6-12 months on GFD to assess for dietary adherence and mucosal healing [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/812).

**Referrals:**
- Gastroenterology: for endoscopic confirmation, assessment of celiac-related complications, and management oversight [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/812).
- Dietitian: expert advice in gluten-free diet, nutritional adequacy, and patient education [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/812).

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Patient education on need for strict lifelong gluten avoidance and risks of inadvertent exposure.
- Encourage regular follow-up for monitoring of nutritional status, symptom recurrence, and long-term complications (including osteoporosis) [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/812).
- Advise on reading labels, preventing cross-contamination, and seeking support groups for individuals with celiac disease.
- Counsel regarding vaccination for pneumococcus and other encapsulated organisms if hyposplenism is suspected/confirmed (later stage risk in longstanding coeliac disease) [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/812).

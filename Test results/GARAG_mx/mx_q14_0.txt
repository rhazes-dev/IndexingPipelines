## Summary
- 72-year-old male with progressive memory loss, slowness, and classical parkinsonian features (resting tremor, rigidity, shuffling gait, reduced arm swing, hypophonic speech) over 1 year.
- MRI brain unremarkable.
- Clinical scenario suggests parkinsonism with cognitive decline; possible Parkinson’s disease dementia or Parkinson-plus syndrome.

## Problems and Assessments

1. Parkinsonism (probable Parkinson-plus syndrome or advanced Parkinson’s disease)
   - Features: resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia (slowness), shuffling gait, reduced arm swing, hypophonic speech, cognitive impairment.
   - Rapid progression and unremarkable imaging suggest a possible Parkinson-plus syndrome (e.g., dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP), multiple system atrophy (MSA)) rather than classical PD. Memory loss is prominent[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
   
2. Cognitive Impairment/Dementia
   - Significant memory loss and slow processing, progressively worsening.
   - May represent a comorbid degenerative dementia or part of a syndrome (e.g., DLB or Parkinson’s disease dementia)[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- Formal cognitive assessment (e.g., MMSE or MoCA) to quantify dementia severity and monitor progression[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- Blood tests: full blood count, chemistry panel, thyroid function, vitamin B12 to exclude reversible causes of cognitive decline[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- No further neuroimaging needed at present if MRI is unremarkable unless atypical or new features appear[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/26681).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Trial of levodopa (co-careldopa/co-beneldopa or levodopa-carbidopa) as first-line for parkinsonism; response may be limited in Parkinson-plus syndromes but should be attempted for symptom control when appropriate[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125). 
- Consider adjunctive agents: MAO-B inhibitors (e.g., selegiline), dopamine agonists, or amantadine if levodopa insufficient[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- Tremor management: consider propranolol, clonazepam, or gabapentin if disabling[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- Anticholinergics (e.g., benzhexol/trihexyphenidyl) and baclofen can reduce rigidity/tremor, but use with caution due to cognitive side effects, especially in elderly[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- Cognitive symptoms: Cholinesterase inhibitors (donepezil, rivastigmine) or memantine may be considered if dementia is prominent[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- Speech therapy for hypophonia and assessment/management of dysphagia[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- Physical therapy to improve mobility, prevent falls, and maintain flexibility. Tailor exercises to patient’s capacity[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- Occupational therapy to maximise independence in activities of daily living[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- Dietician input to optimise nutrition and weight[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- Initiate measures for patient and carer support, including advance care planning as appropriate[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).

**Referrals:**
- Neurology referral for confirmation of diagnosis, monitoring disease progression, and support with complex management decisions[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- Consider geriatric or memory clinic referral for advanced cognitive assessment and multidisciplinary care planning[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Fall prevention strategies: home hazard assessment, mobility aids, and education to reduce injury risk during ambulation[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- Encourage regular physical activity as tolerated to maintain mobility and function[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- Discuss driving safety and explore advanced directives as appropriate during appointments.

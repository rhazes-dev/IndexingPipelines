## Summary
- 72-year-old man with progressive memory loss and slowness over one year
- Resting tremor, rigidity, shuffling gait, reduced arm swing, and hypophonic speech
- MRI brain unremarkable
- Features point to parkinsonism with cognitive decline

## Problems and Assessments

1. Parkinsonism with Dementia
   - Presents with bradykinesia, resting tremor, rigidity, postural and gait instability, hypophonia, and shuffling gait; cognitive decline is significant.
   - Unremarkable MRI supports diagnosis of an idiopathic neurodegenerative disorder (likely Parkinson disease or a Parkinson-plus syndrome), and absence of structural pathology makes secondary causes less likely[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/26681).
   - Reduced response to dopaminergic medications and rapid progression would raise possibility of a Parkinson-plus syndrome, but this is not specified at this stage[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).

2. Functional Decline and Fall Risk
   - Slowness, rigidity, shuffling gait, and reduced arm swing increase falls risk and impact activities of daily living.

3. Cognitive Impairment/Dementia
   - Progressive memory loss suggests concomitant dementia (e.g., Parkinson’s disease dementia or Lewy body dementia)[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- Routine bloods: CBC, chemistry panel, thyroid function, vitamin B12 to rule out reversible cognitive contributors and co-morbidities[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- Formal cognitive assessment (e.g., MoCA or MMSE) to document baseline cognitive impairment[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- Consider dopamine transporter (DAT) imaging (SPECT/PET), if available, to distinguish degenerative parkinsonism from non-degenerative causes or if diagnosis is unclear[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/26681).
- Continued symptom monitoring and periodic reassessment to clarify syndrome progression and response to management[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/26681),[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Trial of levodopa/carbidopa for motor symptoms; monitor for response as it supports a diagnosis of idiopathic Parkinson’s disease but may have limited effect in Parkinson-plus syndromes[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- If levodopa is ineffective or only partially effective, add or trial monoamine oxidase type B (MAO-B) inhibitor (e.g., selegiline), dopamine agonist (e.g., pramipexole), or amantadine, as per symptom burden and tolerance[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- For disabling tremor, consider propranolol or clonazepam if not contraindicated and with careful monitoring for side effects[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- Initiate physical therapy focusing on gait, balance, strength, and fall prevention[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- Occupational therapy referral to address activity of daily living limitations and home modifications for safety[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- Speech and language therapy for hypophonia and screening for dysphagia[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- Cognitive impairment: trial cholinesterase inhibitor (e.g., rivastigmine) if dementia is clinically significant and no contraindications exist[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- Address neuropsychiatric symptoms as indicated (e.g., manage mood, agitation, psychosis—with extreme caution using antipsychotics if required, as these can worsen parkinsonism)[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- Regular medication review to minimise drugs that exacerbate parkinsonism or delirium.

**Referrals:**
- Neurology for diagnostic clarification, optimisation of pharmacological and multidisciplinary management, and follow-up[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- Geriatrician or memory clinic for further cognitive workup and multidisciplinary dementia care[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- Physical, occupational, and speech therapy as above.

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Home safety assessment and fall prevention strategies as the patient is at high risk of falls.
- Encourage regular, supervised exercise as tolerated.
- Educate patient and caregivers on disease, medication schedule, and signs of deterioration.
- Advanced care planning discussions recommended given the progressive nature of disorder[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/143125).
- Nutritional support/dietician referral if weight loss or swallowing concerns develop.

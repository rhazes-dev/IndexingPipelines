## Summary
- 72-year-old man with 12 months’ progressive memory decline, impaired daily functioning, repetitiveness, disorientation, and object misplacement.
- Physical examination unremarkable.
- MRI: Bilateral hippocampal atrophy.
- Blood tests (B12, folate, TFTs, calcium) normal.
- Clinical picture and MRI suggest Alzheimer’s disease (AD)[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17423).

## Problems and Assessments

1. Alzheimer’s Disease—Probable
   - Progressive memory impairment (especially episodic), repetitive questioning, functional decline, and disorientation over a year, with bilateral hippocampal atrophy and unrevealing metabolic workup, are classic for AD[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17423).
2. Loss of ability to perform activities of daily living (ADLs)
   - Progressive cognitive deterioration impacting independence and safety; significant for further care planning[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20337).

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- No further diagnostic workup is indicated at this stage; reversible causes (B12, folate, TFTs, calcium) have been excluded, and MRI supports AD[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17423).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Initiate cholinesterase inhibitor (e.g., donepezil, rivastigmine, galantamine) as first-line symptomatic therapy; may modestly slow cognitive decline and improve function in mild-to-moderate AD[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17423).
- Consider memantine (NMDA receptor antagonist) add-on in moderate to severe stages for additional symptomatic benefit[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17423).
- Regular cognitive stimulation: Encourage engagement in mentally stimulating activities and socialisation to maintain function[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17423).
- Recommend aerobic exercise: Evidence suggests this can slow functional/cognitive decline in AD[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17423).
- Review current medications for anticholinergic burden or agents that could worsen cognition; avoid polypharmacy if possible[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17423).
- Provide functional/occupational therapy input to optimise independence and safety with ADLs[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20337).
- Advise on implementation of home safety modifications (e.g., removal of hazards, installation of alarms/locks, use of reminders)[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20337).
- Educate and support family/caregiver, monitoring for carer strain and ensuring resources are available for respite if needed[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20337).
- Regularly reassess for behavioural and psychological symptoms of dementia (BPSD; e.g., depression, psychosis, agitation); treat if they emerge[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20337).

**Referrals:**
- Refer to specialist memory clinic or neurologist for confirmation of diagnosis, ongoing monitoring, and access to multidisciplinary support[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20337).
- Social worker/community services for evaluation of support needs, eligibility for home help or day care, and advance care planning discussion[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20337).

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Encourage ongoing physical activity, social interaction, and cognitive engagement to preserve function[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17423).
- Provide advice to patient/family regarding driving safety and, where appropriate, notify relevant authorities/services[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20337).
- Discuss and document wishes regarding future care decisions (advance directives, lasting power of attorney)[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20337).

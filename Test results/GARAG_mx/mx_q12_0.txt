## Summary
- 35-year-old woman with pleuritic chest pain and breathlessness post long-haul flight.
- Tachycardic (HR 112), hypoxic (SpO₂ 90%), tachypnoeic (RR 22).
- Anxious and haemodynamically stable; CXR is clear.
- D-dimer elevated; ECG: sinus tachycardia.
- Recent immobility and clinical findings highly suspicious for acute pulmonary embolism (PE).

## Problems and Assessments

1. Acute Pulmonary Embolism (Possible)
   - Classic risk factors (recent long-haul flight), clinical presentation (pleuritic chest pain, dyspnoea, tachycardia, hypoxia), and elevated D-dimer support a high pre-test probability for PE. Clear CXR and sinus tachycardia on ECG further support this diagnosis in absence of localising lung or cardiac findings [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/42576), [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19382), [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20071).
   
2. Hypoxia
   - SpO₂ 90% indicates significant hypoxaemia, likely secondary to V/Q mismatch from PE.

3. Anxiety (Possible)
   - Likely secondary to cardiorespiratory distress and perception of severe, sudden symptoms.

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- CT Pulmonary Angiogram (CTPA): Gold standard to confirm PE in a high-risk, haemodynamically stable patient [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19382), [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20071).
- Lower limb Doppler ultrasound: If CTPA contraindicated/unavailable or if suspicion of DVT is high, to detect proximal lower limb DVT as potential source [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/42576).
- ABG: Assess the severity of hypoxaemia and rule out significant CO₂ retention [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/42576).
- Routine labs (CBC, coagulation profile, U&E, LFT): Baseline before anticoagulation, identify coagulopathy or other organ dysfunction [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19382).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Oxygen therapy: Titrate SpO₂ to >94% using nasal cannula or face mask as required [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19382).
- Anticoagulation: Initiate empirical therapeutic anticoagulation in the absence of major contraindications while awaiting confirmation, as per guideline for patients with high clinical suspicion of PE [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19382), [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20071). Options:
  - LMWH (e.g., enoxaparin), or
  - Unfractionated heparin IV infusion (consider especially if renal function is impaired or if rapid reversal may be needed).
- Thrombolysis: Not indicated unless haemodynamically unstable/massive PE [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19382).
- Analgesia: Paracetamol (acetaminophen) preferred; avoid NSAIDs due to potential risk of renal injury and bleeding if on anticoagulants [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19382).
- Cardiac monitoring and early warning score: Monitor for clinical deterioration or arrhythmia [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/42576).

**Referrals:**
- Urgent referral to internal medicine/respiratory team for further management and disposition planning [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19382).
- Consider haematology consult if underlying coagulopathy or thrombophilia suspected (e.g., young, unprovoked event, family history).

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Patient education on VTE risk reduction: Mobilisation on future flights, consideration of compression stockings for high-risk extended travel [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/42576), [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20071).
- Long-term anticoagulation: Duration determined by clinical risk factors and specialist assessment; arrange follow-up.

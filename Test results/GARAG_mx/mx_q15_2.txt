## Summary
- 50-year-old man with worsening SOB and dry cough.
- Clubbing and upper lobe crepitations noted.
- Long history as a sandblaster.
- CXR: upper zone fibrosis.
- Occupational exposure highly suggestive of chronic silicosis (a pneumoconiosis).

## Problems and Assessments

1. Silicosis (chronic occupational pneumoconiosis)
   - Classic clinical, radiological, and occupational features consistent with silicosis. Upper lobe fibrosis and sandblaster exposure are key. Disease is progressive and irreversible; risk of complications is high.[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/29026)

2. Progressive massive fibrosis (Possible)
   - Worsening symptoms and upper zone fibrosis may signal advanced stage with formation of conglomerated nodules.[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/29026)

3. Increased risk of tuberculosis and nontuberculous mycobacteriosis
   - Silicosis markedly raises risk for TB due to impaired macrophage function.[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/29026)

4. Respiratory impairment, hypoxaemia, and decreased exercise tolerance
   - Worsening breathlessness, clubbing signal chronic hypoxaemia and limited pulmonary reserve; very likely reduced quality of life.[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/81556)

5. Risk of further occupational exposure
   - Continued sandblasting or similar work may worsen disease progression.[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/29026)

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- Sputum for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) and culture: Rule out active TB due to high risk; indicated for any chronic cough or new infiltrates.[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/29026)
- HRCT chest: Further characterisation of fibrotic changes, nodularity, and exclusion of progressive massive fibrosis or atypical infection.[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/29026)
- Routine labs (FBC, renal, LFTs): Baseline for future reference and general assessment.
- Serial CXR or CT scans: Monitor for progression and complications (e.g. malignancy, massive fibrosis, mycobacterial infection).[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/81556)

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Permanently avoid further exposure to silica: This is the only intervention proven to slow disease progression.[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/29026)
- Pulmonary rehabilitation (community/home-based): Breathing retraining, exercise therapy, endurance and strength training to improve function and QoL.[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/81556)
- Symptomatic treatment of breathlessness: Consider bronchodilators for co-existent COPD, low-flow oxygen for hypoxaemia (if indicated), optimise comorbidities.[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/81556)
- Monitor for TB and lung malignancy: Serial evaluation, prompt treatment if detected.[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/29026)
- In end-stage disease, consider referral for lung transplantation if candidate.[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/81556)
- Smoking cessation advice (if applicable): Further reduces risk of respiratory decline and malignancy.[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/81556)

**Referrals:**
- Respiratory specialist (pulmonologist): For multidisciplinary disease management and ongoing monitoring.
- TB/infectious diseases specialist: If active infection diagnosed or TB exposure suspected.
- Transplant centre (conditional): Only for patients with end-stage irreversible respiratory failure assessed as transplant candidates.[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/81556)

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Occupational health notification/advice: Formal documentation and guidance for workplace safety and avoidance.
- Nutrition and psychosocial support: Part of pulmonary rehab, supports general health and coping.[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/81556)
- Vaccinations: Annual influenza and pneumococcal vaccines to reduce morbidity from superimposed infections.[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/81556)

A urine dipstick and urinalysis (UA) are often the initial tests obtained to screen for MCD. In MCD, the urine typically looks frothy secondary to proteinuria, and the microscopy shows oval fat bodies and fatty casts. Dysmorphic RBCs, acanthocytes, abnormal casts, and proteinuria are findings suggestive of glomerular injury not frequently seen in MCD.[9] Keep in mind that a urine dipstick has its limitations. The dipstick cannot identify the extent or type of proteinuria as it primarily detects albumin and does not detect low molecular weight proteins.[11] False-positive test results are noted in the presence of mucus, blood, pus, alkalinity, or concentration.[12] A 24-hour urine collection is required to quantitate urinary protein.\\n            Urine collection: A spot protein/creatinine ratio greater than 200 mg/mmol in children and protein/creatinine ratio>300-350mg/mmol in adults is consistent with nephrotic syndrome, as is a 24-hour urine collection that reveals a total protein greater than 3 to 3.5 g/24hour in adults. A report of measuring protein output as gms/m2/hr accounts for differences in body mass. A measurement of 40mg/m2/hour or greater (1gm/m2/24hour) is indicative of proteinuria consistent with nephrotic syndrome in children. Microscopic hematuria is present in 10% to 30% of adults.[13]\\n            Complete metabolic panel (CMP): CMP demonstrates a low total protein, low albumin (frequently <2.5 g/dl), and low total calcium (ionized calcium binds to albumin, and albumin is low).\\n            Complete blood count (CBC): CBC will show hemoconcentration and thrombocytosis. This is seen due to the intravascular volume contraction from fluid sequestration into the interstitial space.\\n            Total cholesterol and triglyceride levels: These are increased due to an increase in hepatic lipoprotein synthesis as a result of low oncotic pressures.', SNIPPET: 'In children, MCD is the most common...'\n",

Hyperlipidemia is due to the increased lipoprotein synthesis secondary to hypoalbuminemia, which causes increased platelet aggregation and thrombosis. The loss of minerals and vitamins predispose to malnutrition and infections.[6] Hypothyroidism develops due to the loss of thyroid-binding globulin in the urine.[4]\\n        Histopathology\\n        The most typical feature in the histology of congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type is irregular microcystic dilatation of the proximal tubule.[3] The glomeruli are normal or may show matrix expansion and mesangial hypercellularity.[7]\\n        History and Physical\\n        Prenatal and perinatal history: placental weight below 25% of newborn weight, enlarged prenatal nuchal translucency, fetal edema, increased amniotic fluid alpha-fetoprotein, and oligohydramnios \\n        Family history: history of congenital nephrotic syndrome, consanguinity, ethnicity, early infantile death,  neurological and kidney diseases of infancy.\\n        Patient history: swelling, poor growth\\n        Physical examination: signs of edema (e.g., pericardial, pleural effusions, and ascites.\\n        Evaluation\\n        Congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type can be diagnosed prenatally by elevated maternal serum alfa fetoprotein, MSAFP (>2.5 MoM) at the second trimester of pregnancy.\\n        Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) may be normal in the beginning but typically increases during the first month. Free thyroxine (T4) is low.\\n        Blood biochemistry: blood count, levels of sodium, chloride, magnesium, protein, albumin,  creatinine, urea, cholesterol, fasting triglycerides, and glucose.\\n        Other factors included in the evaluation include:\\n            Serum IgG level. Serum levels of  phosphate, ionized calcium, 25(OH) vitamin D3, alkaline phosphatase, and PTH\\n            Serum urea and creatinine levels are variable. Renal function is often normal for the first months.[2]\\n            The serum analysis demonstrates hypoalbuminemia (<2.5 mg/dL and low thyroid hormone level.[4]\\n            The urinalysis demonstrates proteinuria (>2000 mg/L), hematuria, and leukocyturia with a negative urine culture.[4]\\n            Ultrasound scanning shows kidneys of normal size or larger, and the renal cortex is hyperechogenic.[2] \\n            Cardiac ultrasound (effusions and left ventricular mass)\\n        Kidney biopsy demonstrates microcystic dilatation of proximal tubules, increased mesangial hypercellularity, and a mild increase in the mesangial matrix in light microscopy. Electron microscopy demonstrates the effacement of podocyte foot processes. [4]\\n        The modality of choice for precise Congenital nephrotic syndrome of the Finnish type diagnosis is the genetic analysis by detection of mutations in NPHS1.[4]\\n        Treatment / Management\\n        Congenital nephrotic syndrome therapy goals are to control edema, prevent and treat complications including infections and thromboses, and provide optimal nutrition for the child to help grow. Kidney transplantation is the only curative treatment in most cases.[2]\\nAlbumin Infusions\\n        Proteinuria leads to life-threatening complications, including protein malnutrition, edema, and reduced growth.\\n        Protein substitution by parenteral albumin infusions is required for heavy and constant proteinuria (10 to 100 g/L).  Usually (3 to 4 g/kg per day of albumin), 20% albumin solution together with a bolus of intravenous furosemide (0.5 mg/kg) using central venous catheters is given.\\nMedications \\n        Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors and indomethacin are used to reduce the protein excretion in urine. \\n        Thyroxine substitution is recommended in congenital nephrotic syndrome patients for low levels of serum thyroid-binding globulin and thyroxine.', SNIPPET: 'leads to proteinuria.

            "\n",
            "**Treatment and Supportive Management:**\n",
            "- Maintain airway, breathing, and circulation (ABC), consider non-invasive ventilation (e.g., CPAP/BiPAP) for hypoxia or fatigue, progressing to intubation if needed [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25703 \"Heart failure is a chronic, progressive...\"), [5](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25481 \"Ultrafiltration (UF) is the most effective...\").\n",

            "- IV loop diuretics (e.g., furosemide) at lowest effective dose, recognising limited efficacy at eGFR 10 and high risk of electrolyte imbalance. Monitor for response [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25703 \"Heart failure is a chronic, progressive...\"), [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25703 \"failure. Ordering multiple routine tests should...\"). May require escalation.\n",
            "- Vasodilators (e.g., IV nitroglycerin) may be cautiously considered to reduce preload/afterload only if BP is adequate; avoid sodium nitroprusside due to severe renal impairment and risk of cyanide toxicity [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25703 \"failure. Ordering multiple routine tests should...\").\n",
            "- Avoid nephrotoxic drugs and medications that can worsen cardiac or renal function (e.g., NSAIDs, ACE inhibitors in acute decompensation).\n",
            "- Ultrafiltration (UF) should be considered early in refractory volume overload or diuretic resistance; UF is preferred as it removes sodium/water effectively in advanced HF+CKD, optimises fluid status, and is not associated with the same nephrotoxic risk as aggressive diuresis. Can stabilise respiratory and haemodynamic status [5](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25481 \"Ultrafiltration (UF) is the most effective...\").\n",
            "- Routine inotropes generally avoided unless in frank cardiogenic shock; mechanical support (IABP/VAD) only if appropriate and consistent with patient goals due to frailty [5](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25481 \"Ultrafiltration (UF) is the most effective...\").\n",

A urine dipstick and urinalysis (UA) are often the initial tests obtained to screen for MCD. In MCD, the urine typically looks frothy secondary to proteinuria, and the microscopy shows oval fat bodies and fatty casts. Dysmorphic RBCs, acanthocytes, abnormal casts, and proteinuria are findings suggestive of glomerular injury not frequently seen in MCD.[9] Keep in mind that a urine dipstick has its limitations. The dipstick cannot identify the extent or type of proteinuria as it primarily detects albumin and does not detect low molecular weight proteins.[11] False-positive test results are noted in the presence of mucus, blood, pus, alkalinity, or concentration.[12] A 24-hour urine collection is required to quantitate urinary protein.\\n            Urine collection: A spot protein/creatinine ratio greater than 200 mg/mmol in children and protein/creatinine ratio>300-350mg/mmol in adults is consistent with nephrotic syndrome, as is a 24-hour urine collection that reveals a total protein greater than 3 to 3.5 g/24hour in adults. A report of measuring protein output as gms/m2/hr accounts for differences in body mass. A measurement of 40mg/m2/hour or greater (1gm/m2/24hour) is indicative of proteinuria consistent with nephrotic syndrome in children. Microscopic hematuria is present in 10% to 30% of adults.[13]\\n            Complete metabolic panel (CMP): CMP demonstrates a low total protein, low albumin (frequently <2.5 g/dl), and low total calcium (ionized calcium binds to albumin, and albumin is low).\\n            Complete blood count (CBC): CBC will show hemoconcentration and thrombocytosis.

Along with fluids, an intravenous infusion of regular insulin has to be initiated to maintain the blood glucose level between 150 to 200 mg/dl and until the high anion-gap acidosis is resolved in DKA. Like mentioned above, potassium levels are usually high because of the transcellular shifts due to the acidosis and the lack of insulin. When the potassium levels are low, this means that the total body potassium is low, and hence, insulin therapy should be postponed till at least the level of serum potassium is greater than 3.3 mEq/L. Otherwise, a further drop in levels would put the patient at risk for cardiac arrhythmias. In the 3.3 to 5 mEq/L; range, supplementation should be added in the maintenance fluids to target a steady 4.0 to 5.0 mEq/L range, and if higher than that, insulin and intravenous fluids alone can be started with just the frequent monitoring of the serum potassium level. The treatment of the acidosis itself is more controversial. Treatment with sodium bicarbonate therapy is controversial. It has been studied and found to provide no added benefit when the arterial blood pH is greater than 6.9 and may be associated with more harm...[7] A 2011 systematic review found that bicarbonate administration worsened ketonemia.

## Summary
- 35-year-old woman with classic Cushingoid features: weight gain, central obesity, purple striae, hypertension, facial plethora, dorsocervical fat pad, proximal muscle weakness, and menstrual irregularity.
- Laboratory: elevated serum cortisol not suppressed by dexamethasone, and significantly elevated ACTHâ€”suggesting ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome (very likely Cushing disease) as opposed to ectopic ACTH (less common at this age) or adrenal causes.

## Problems and Assessments

1. ACTH-Dependent Cushing Syndrome (probable Cushing disease)
   - Clinical features and biochemistry (high cortisol unresponsive to dexamethasone, high ACTH) are most consistent with Cushing disease (pituitary ACTH-producing adenoma), though ectopic ACTH syndrome should also be excluded given markedly elevated ACTH[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20178),[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20047).

2. Hypertension and Cardiometabolic Complications
   - Secondary hypertension and metabolic derangements resulting from chronic hypercortisolism; raises cardiovascular risk[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20047).

3. Myopathy/Proximal Muscle Weakness
   - Cortisol excess contributes to muscle protein catabolism and weakness[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20047).

4. Menstrual Irregularity and Androgen Excess
   - Gonadal axis suppression and increased adrenal androgens due to hypercortisolism[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17242).

5. Risk of Infection, Osteoporosis, and Impaired Glucose Tolerance
   - Chronic corticosteroid excess raises infection risk, decreases bone density, and causes impaired glucose metabolism[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20178),[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20047).

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- MRI of the pituitary (with contrast): To localise a pituitary ACTH-secreting adenoma (Cushing disease); first-line imaging for ACTH-dependent Cushing after lab confirmation[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20178).
- High-dose dexamethasone suppression test (if not already performed): Further distinguishes pituitary from ectopic ACTH sources; pituitary (Cushing disease) often shows partial suppression[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20178).
- Inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS): If imaging is equivocal or the source remains unclear, IPSS confirms pituitary vs. ectopic ACTH source[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20178).
- Chest/abdominal imaging (CT): If pituitary imaging is negative or to look for ectopic ACTH source (e.g., small-cell lung cancer)[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20178).
- Baseline bone mineral density (DEXA): To evaluate for osteoporosis due to chronic hypercortisolism[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20178).
- Fasting glucose/HbA1c and lipid profile: Assess metabolic complications[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20047).
- Investigations for infectious risk (if clinically indicated): Screen for latent infections before definitive therapy[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20178).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Definitive treatment: Transsphenoidal surgical resection of pituitary adenoma is first-line for confirmed Cushing disease[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20178).
- Preoperative medical therapy (if needed to control hypercortisolism or if surgery is delayed):
    - Steroidogenesis inhibitors: ketoconazole, metyrapone, or osilodrostat can be used temporarily to control cortisol excess[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20178).
    - Mifepristone (glucocorticoid receptor antagonist) may be considered in selected cases, especially if surgery is contraindicated or unsuccessful[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20047).
- Address metabolic and cardiovascular risk:
    - Hypertension: Antihypertensives as appropriate for blood pressure target[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20047).
    - Dysglycaemia: Optimise glycaemic control, monitor closely for diabetes[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20047).
    - Osteoporosis: Consider calcium, vitamin D supplementation, and bisphosphonates if osteoporosis is present[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20178).
- Prevent infection: Prompt evaluation and treatment of infections[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20178).
- Monitor for adrenal insufficiency post-treatment: Glucocorticoid replacement (e.g., hydrocortisone) as needed during the perioperative period and following cure[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20178).

**Referrals:**
- Endocrinology: For further workup, definitive management, and postoperative hormone management[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20178).
- Neurosurgery: For transsphenoidal pituitary surgery if indicated[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20178).
- Consider additional specialties as needed based on comorbidities (e.g., cardiology for refractory hypertension).

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Advise weight optimisation and dietary measures to address metabolic risk[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20047).
- Counsel on infection prevention (vaccination, prompt medical attention for illness)[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20178).
- Encourage mobilisation and physical activity as tolerated to minimise bone/muscle loss[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20047).
- Smoking cessation and alcohol moderation if relevant[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20047).

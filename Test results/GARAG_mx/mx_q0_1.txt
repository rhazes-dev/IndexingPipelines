## Summary
- 86-year-old male with known congestive cardiac failure (CCF)
- Presents with pulmonary oedema on chest X-ray
- Ejection fraction (EF) 30% (i.e., HFrEF)
- Advanced renal dysfunction with eGFR 10 (CKD G5, likely ESRD)
----

## Problems and Assessments

1. Acute decompensated heart failure with pulmonary oedema
   - Life-threatening; pulmonary oedema evident on imaging with markedly reduced EF. Requires urgent management to relieve congestion and reduce mortality risk. Underlying chronic CCF is present, now acutely decompensated.
2. Severe chronic kidney disease (CKD) / End-stage renal disease (ESRD)
   - eGFR 10 denotes advanced CKD (Stage G5), which severely limits fluid/electrolyte handling and restricts usual heart failure pharmacotherapy. May require renal replacement therapy. Impacts both fluid management and medication safety.
3. Fluid overload
   - Manifesting as pulmonary oedema, largely due to combination of CCF and impaired renal function. Loop diuretics may be less effective due to renal dysfunction.
4. Polypharmacy/Medication risks
   - Significant risk of adverse drug events with impaired renal excretion; many standard heart failure drugs are nephrotoxic or require dose adjustment/omission.

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- Daily weights and strict input/output charting: To monitor response to therapy and fluid status.
- Serum electrolytes, creatinine, urea: To monitor solute control, metabolic derangements, and guide therapy.
- ECG and cardiac monitoring: Screen for arrhythmias, myocardial ischaemia, or QT prolongation.
- Echocardiogram if not recent: To confirm EF and assess for other cardiac issues (valve disease, worsening function).
- Monitor for complications of severe hyperkalaemia, acidosis, or uraemia: Prompt detection is necessary for early dialysis.

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**

- Oxygen supplementation as required: To correct hypoxaemia due to pulmonary oedema[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19880).
- Upright positioning: To improve pulmonary mechanics and symptom relief[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19880).
- Loop diuretics IV (e.g., furosemide): Cautiously, as effectiveness diminishes with severe renal failure, but still first-line for acute pulmonary oedema. Titrate to effect and monitor response. Higher doses are often required; may not be effective in eGFR ~10[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28013).
- Consider ultrafiltration (renal replacement therapy): If diuresis fails or severe volume overload persists, ultrafiltration is more effective than loop diuretics for sodium/water removal and is often necessary in decompensated heart failure with ESRD[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28020).
- Avoid ACE inhibitors/ARBs and mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists: Contraindicated (or require extreme caution) in advanced CKD due to risk of worsening hyperkalaemia and renal function[4](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/91960).
- Vasodilators (e.g., nitrates): May be helpful for symptom relief in cases without hypotension; dose cautiously as renal failure can prolong effects[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28013).
- Beta-blockers: Continue only if already established and the patient is haemodynamically stable; do not initiate or uptitrate during acute decompensation.
- Careful fluid restriction: Balance fluid restriction with avoidance of hypotension and hypoperfusion.
- Monitor for indications for urgent dialysis: Severe, refractory fluid overload, hyperkalaemia, metabolic acidosis, or uraemia not responding to medical therapy[4](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/91960).
- Avoid nephrotoxic drugs (NSAIDs, aminoglycosides, IV contrast, etc.): These will exacerbate renal failure[4](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/91960).
- Nutritional support: Avoid protein overload, but prevent catabolism; consider enteral route where possible, monitor for malnutrition[4](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/91960).

**Referrals:**
- Nephrology (Renal) for urgent review: For assessment of need/timing of renal replacement therapy (dialysis/ultrafiltration)[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28020).
- Cardiology: For input on advanced HF management, echocardiogram review, and optimisation where possible.

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Low sodium diet: To limit fluid overload and reduce hypertension.
- Education of patient/family re: fluid and salt restriction, daily weights, and early signs of decompensation (if appropriate).
- Avoidance of nephrotoxic medications and over-the-counter drugs.
- Review and optimise chronic CCF and ESRD management after acute phase.

## Summary
- 62-year-old man with cough, haemoptysis, weight loss, and arthralgia.
- Exam: saddle-nose deformity, purpuric rash.
- CXR: cavitating lung lesions.
- Creatinine elevated (180 μmol/L).
- Features strongly suggest granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) with pulmonary-renal syndrome and ENT involvement.

## Problems and Assessments

1. Granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA) (Confirmed)
   - Classic presentation: upper (saddle-nose, possible chronic rhinosinusitis) and lower respiratory tract involvement (cough, haemoptysis, lung cavitation), renal impairment, and cutaneous vasculitis (purpura, arthralgia).
   - Multisystem small/medium vessel necrotizing vasculitis; if untreated, high morbidity/mortality from organ dysfunction.[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/76416)

2. Renal involvement/rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) (Confirmed)
   - Markedly elevated creatinine indicates renal involvement; at risk of rapid deterioration and end-stage renal disease without early intervention.[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717)

3. Pulmonary involvement (Confirmed)
   - Cavitating lung lesions, haemoptysis: risk for diffuse alveolar haemorrhage and secondary infection.[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/76416)

4. Cutaneous and articular involvement (Confirmed)
   - Purpuric rash and arthralgia suggest active systemic small vessel vasculitis.[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717)

5. High risk of life-threatening complications (Confirmed)
   - Potential for pulmonary-renal syndrome, severe bleeding, infection due to immunosuppression, and progressive renal failure.[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/76416)

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- ANCA serology (PR3/c-ANCA and MPO/p-ANCA): To confirm suspected GPA; PR3-ANCA highly sensitive/specific for GPA.[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/76416)
- Renal function, urinalysis (for hematuria, proteinuria, red cell casts): Assess extent of renal involvement/RPGN.[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717)
- Chest CT: Better characterization of pulmonary lesions, exclude infection or malignancy.[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/76416)
- Tissue biopsy (preferably lung or nasal for granuloma; renal for crescentic GN): Needed for diagnostic confirmation and to rule out mimics; look for necrotizing granulomatous inflammation (lung, nasal) or pauci-immune GN (renal).[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717)
- Baseline infectious screen (hepatitis B/C, HIV, TB): Before immunosuppression initiation.
- Full blood count, LFTs, CRP/ESR: Baseline for systemic involvement and therapy monitoring.

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Initiate high-dose glucocorticoids: Methylprednisolone IV pulses (e.g., 500–1000 mg daily for 3 days) followed by oral prednisolone (1 mg/kg/day), then gradual taper once control established.[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/76416)
- Add induction immunosuppression:
    - Rituximab IV (preferred; first-line, as effective as cyclophosphamide for induction and relapse; especially if fertility a concern, age >60, or previous cyclophosphamide exposure) OR
    - Cyclophosphamide IV or oral (consider where rituximab unavailable/contraindicated).[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/76416)
- Plasmapheresis (Plasma exchange): Consider in rapidly progressive crescentic glomerulonephritis with severe renal dysfunction (eGFR <50 or rising creatinine), or severe diffuse alveolar haemorrhage.[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717)
- Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PJP) prophylaxis: Co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) unless contraindicated, due to immunosuppression.
- Supportive care: Blood pressure control (ACE inhibitor/ARB if proteinuria and renal function allows), infection monitoring and prevention, management of pulmonary haemorrhage, and VTE prophylaxis if not actively bleeding.
- Taper immunosuppressives per protocol after remission, then start maintenance regimen (e.g., azathioprine, rituximab).[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/76416)
- Avoid nephrotoxins; careful monitoring of renal and hepatic function.

**Referrals:**
- Urgent referral to/coordination with nephrology, rheumatology, and pulmonology: For comprehensive, multisystem management, biopsy, and immunosuppressive protocol planning.[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/76416)
- ENT: For management of upper airway involvement and reconstructive input for saddle-nose, if applicable.

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Vaccination (e.g. influenza, pneumococcal, COVID-19): Prior to/during immunosuppression, as appropriate and safe.
- Bone protection (calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonates if risk factors present) during chronic steroid use.
- Patient support and education: Early infection signs, medication adherence, and monitoring requirements.

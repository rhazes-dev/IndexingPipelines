## Summary
- 34F with heat intolerance, weight loss, anxiety, amenorrhoea.
- Fine tremor, lid lag, diffuse goitre on exam.
- TSH suppressed, free T4 elevated.
- Positive TPO and TRAb antibodies.
- Clinical and biochemical features are consistent with Graves disease (autoimmune hyperthyroidism) with thyrotoxic symptoms including menstrual disturbance and neuropsychiatric signs [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/30167).

## Problems and Assessments

1. Graves Disease (Autoimmune Hyperthyroidism)
   - Leading cause of thyrotoxicosis in young women; TSHR antibodies mediate excess hormone production and diffuse goitre. Presents with typical thyrotoxic symptoms (heat intolerance, weight loss, anxiety, amenorrhoea, tremor, lid lag), positive TPO and TRAb[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/30167).
2. Thyrotoxic State (With Target Organ Effects)
   - Manifestations include weight loss, anxiety, fine tremor, amenorrhoea, risk of cardiac (arrhythmia, heart failure) and bone (osteoporosis) complications if untreated[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/30167).

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- Thyroid Ultrasound: Assess for nodularity, exclude other pathology, and document gland size/vascularity. Justification: Excludes other causes of goitre, supports Graves diagnosis, informs treatment planning [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/30167).
- Baseline ECG: Screen for arrhythmias, particularly AF, prior to starting beta-blocker therapy if indicated [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/30167).
- Full Blood Count, Liver and Renal Profile: Baseline prior to anti-thyroid drug therapy due to risk of agranulocytosis and hepatitis [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/30167).
- Corrected Calcium & Bone Profile: Screen for thyrotoxic bone disease (osteoporosis risk) [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/30167).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- First-line: Anti-thyroid drugs—carbimazole (preferred UK) or methimazole (US), titration or block-replace regimen. Rationale: Restores euthyroidism, indicated for initial management of Graves disease [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/30167).
- Alternate (if intolerant or contraindicated): Propylthiouracil, especially if first trimester of pregnancy. Note higher risk of hepatitis [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/30167).
- Beta-blocker (e.g., propranolol): Symptomatic relief of tremor, anxiety, palpitations, and heat intolerance as a bridge to definitive control [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/30167).
- Radioactive iodine ablation: Second-line if relapse on medical therapy; not suitable in pregnancy/lactation. Requires euthyroidism prior to procedure and monitoring for hypothyroidism post-treatment [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/30167).
- Thyroidectomy: Consider if large goitre, compressive symptoms, poor drug tolerance, relapse, or patient choice. Requires pre-operative euthyroid state [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/30167).
- Monitor for agranulocytosis/hepatotoxicity: Advise patient to report sore throat, fever, or jaundice promptly during antithyroid drug therapy [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/30167).
- Regular TFTs: Monitor response to therapy (every 4–6 weeks initially) [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/30167).

**Referrals:**
- Endocrinology: Specialist input for establishing management (anti-thyroid regimen/radioiodine/surgical referral), education, and follow-up for remission/relapse monitoring [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/30167).
- Ophthalmology: If signs of orbitopathy develop (pain, diplopia, vision disturbance), consider urgent referral [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/30167).

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Smoking Cessation: To reduce risk and severity of Graves orbitopathy [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/30167).
- Advise on contraception: Avoid pregnancy until euthyroid and stable, as anti-thyroid drugs and radioactive iodine contraindicated in pregnancy [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/30167).
- Dietary guidance: Adequate calcium/vitamin D intake to mitigate osteoporosis risk during thyrotoxic phase [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/30167).
- Patient education: Signs/symptoms of thyroid storm and drug adverse effects [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/30167).

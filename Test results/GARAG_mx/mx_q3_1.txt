## Summary
- 55-year-old male with sudden severe, tearing chest pain radiating to the back.
- Marked hypertension (190/110 mmHg) and tachycardia (110 bpm).
- Examination: pulse deficit and BP difference of 30 mmHg between arms.
- ECG: no ischaemic changes; CXR: widened mediastinum.
- Clinical picture highly suggestive of acute aortic dissection, likely Stanford type A.

## Problems and Assessments

1. Acute Aortic Dissection (Stanford type A) (Possible)
   - Clinical features (sudden tearing chest pain radiating to the back, pulse deficit, BP asymmetry, widened mediastinum) and risk factors (hypertension) are classic for acute aortic dissection, especially type A (ascending aorta involvement), which is a surgical emergency [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/135228), [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17034).
2. Hypertensive Emergency
   - Severe hypertension exacerbates risk of extension, rupture, or malperfusion; urgent control is needed [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/135228).
3. End-organ Malperfusion Risk
   - Evidence of pulse deficit and differential BP may reflect compromised vascular supply to distal organs or limbs [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/135228).
4. Risk of Missed/Delayed Diagnosis and Complications
   - High mortality risk; delayed intervention worsens outcomes [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/135228), [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17034).

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- Urgent CT angiogram of the chest, abdomen, and pelvis to confirm extent/site of dissection, involvement of branch vessels, and complications; CT is the gold standard for rapid diagnosis [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17034).
- Type and screen for potential transfusion/operative planning.
- Renal function, troponin, and lactate to assess for end-organ ischaemia.
- Continuous cardiac monitoring and repeat ECGs to rule out evolving myocardial ischaemia.
- Repeat BP and pulse checks in all limbs to dynamically assess for evolving malperfusion.

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Immediate blood pressure lowering: Target systolic BP <120 mmHg and HR <60 bpm to reduce aortic wall stress and propagation risk; initiate IV β-blocker (e.g., labetalol) [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/135228).
- If additional BP control needed, add vasodilators (e.g., sodium nitroprusside) but ONLY after beta-blockade to prevent reflex tachycardia [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/135228).
- Strict nil by mouth and maintain intravenous access for resuscitation.
- Oxygen supplementation and analgesia with IV opioids as needed to optimise oxygenation and minimise sympathetic drive [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/135228).
- Prepare for urgent surgical intervention—avoid anticoagulation/thrombolysis.
- Arrange for transfer to cardiac surgery centre if not on-site.
- Monitor urine output and neurological status for evidence of end-organ involvement.

**Referrals:**
- Immediate referral to cardiothoracic (cardiac) surgery for emergency operative management (Stanford type A dissection mandates surgery regardless of haemodynamic status); discuss results and readiness for theatre [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/135228), [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17034).
- Involve anaesthesia and critical care teams early for preoperative and perioperative optimisation [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20603).

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- After recovery, long-term strict blood pressure control and risk factor optimisation (e.g., antihypertensive therapy, smoking cessation, lipid management) to reduce risk of recurrence [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/135228).
- Genetic counselling if suspicion for heritable connective tissue disorder in appropriate settings.

## Summary
- 40-year-old man with known HIV (CD4 50 cells/mm³) and poor ART compliance.
- Presents with 2 weeks of worsening headache, confusion, personality change.
- No fever or neck stiffness.
- MRI: multiple ring-enhancing brain lesions.
- High suspicion for cerebral toxoplasmosis on background of severe immunosuppression.

## Problems and Assessments

1. Cerebral toxoplasmosis (probable)
   - Classic presentation in advanced HIV: subacute-onset CNS symptoms, multiple ring-enhancing lesions on imaging, CD4 <100, no ART compliance. Most common CNS mass lesion in AIDS[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).

2. Advanced HIV infection with poor ART adherence
   - High risk for multiple opportunistic infections (OIs) including toxoplasmosis, with very low CD4 count[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22941).

3. Risk of recurrence and complications
   - Toxoplasmosis may relapse if treatment discontinued; profound immunosuppression increases risk of further OIs and complications[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- Serum Toxoplasma gondii IgG and IgM: To support the diagnosis in conjunction with clinical and radiological findings (serology not always positive in severe immunosuppression)[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
- Consider repeat MRI or CT brain after 10–14 days of therapy: To assess radiological response to empiric treatment[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
- If poor response or diagnosis uncertain, consider brain biopsy: Reserved for cases unresponsive to empiric therapy, or if lymphoma or other diagnosis is suspected[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
- Routine labs (CBC, renal/liver function, electrolytes): For medication dosing and monitoring toxicity[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
- Screen for other OIs (e.g., CMV, tuberculosis) as clinically indicated, due to immunosuppression[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22941).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Start empiric therapy for cerebral toxoplasmosis:
    - Pyrimethamine + sulfadiazine + leucovorin (folinic acid) is first-line therapy[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
        - Pyrimethamine: loading dose then daily.
        - Sulfadiazine: weight-based dosing.
        - Leucovorin to prevent hematologic toxicity.
    - If sulfa allergy: Substitute clindamycin for sulfadiazine[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
    - Alternatives: atovaquone-based regimens (for intolerance)[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
- Dexamethasone or other corticosteroids: Only if substantial mass effect or cerebral edema; otherwise avoid due to risk of masking response[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
- Anticonvulsants if seizures occur; avoid for prophylaxis unless clinical seizures[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
- Begin ART (antiretroviral therapy) as soon as feasible, typically within 2 weeks after starting anti-toxoplasma therapy to limit risk of IRIS (immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome), balancing OI management and ART benefit[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
- Monitor for and manage medication side effects, cytopenias, hepatic/renal impairment[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).

- Infectious diseases: For co-management of OI treatment, ART initiation, prophylaxis planning.
- Neurology: For further workup or if alternative diagnoses, ongoing neurological deficits, or diagnostic uncertainty[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Secondary prophylaxis (long-term, usually with TMP-SMX/trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) is needed after acute therapy until CD4 >200 for >6 months on ART[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
- Educate on ART compliance to prevent future OIs[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
- Avoid undercooked meats, unfiltered water, contact with cat litter/soil; reinforce kitchen and personal hygiene[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).
- Counsel about the importance of regular follow-up and adherence to both prophylaxis and ART regimens to reduce relapse and new OIs[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22945).

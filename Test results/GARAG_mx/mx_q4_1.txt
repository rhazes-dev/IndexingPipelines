## Summary
- 28-year-old previously healthy woman with acute onset of descending, symmetrical flaccid paralysis, bilateral ptosis, mydriasis, absent deep tendon reflexes, and bulbar involvement (dysphagia, diplopia).
- No fever, no sensory deficits.
- Strong history of recent ingestion of homemade preserved vegetables.
- Examination: cranial nerve palsies, progressive descending paralysis, respiratory risk.
- Findings suggest classical presentation of foodborne botulism.

## Problems and Assessments

1. Acute Foodborne Botulism (confirmed)
   - Classic features: descending flaccid paralysis, prominent cranial nerve involvement (diplopia, ptosis, mydriasis, dysphagia), symmetrical weakness, preserved sensation, and areflexia following ingestion of home-preserved foods. Life-threatening due to risk of respiratory muscle paralysis and autonomic instability [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25815), [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25817), [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/161699).

2. Impending Respiratory Failure (probable)
   - Rapidly progressive bulbar and respiratory muscle weakness in botulism—requires immediate respiratory monitoring and potential ventilatory support due to risk of respiratory arrest [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25815), [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25817), [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/161699).

3. Autonomic Dysfunction (possible)
   - Botulism often associated with autonomic instability (pupillary abnormalities, GI dysmotility, cardiovascular lability); requires close monitoring [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25815), [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25817), [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/161699).

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- Serum, stool, and gastric aspirate for C. botulinum toxin and organism detection: Confirms diagnosis and guides public health action [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25817).
- Routine labs (CBC, U&Es, LFTs) and arterial blood gas (ABG): Monitor for complications of paralysis (e.g., hypoventilation, aspiration).
- Serial bedside spirometry (vital capacity, NIF): Assess for respiratory muscle involvement and guide need for ventilatory support [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/161699).
- Blood cultures if fever or sepsis suspected, but not typical in pure botulism.
- ECG and continuous monitoring: Evaluate for cardiac dysautonomia [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25815).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Admit to ICU/monitored bed: Need for close observation owing to risk of rapid respiratory decline [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/161699).
- Early administration of botulinum antitoxin (heptavalent equine or human depending on availability): Most effective if given as early as possible; reduces disease progression and duration [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25817), [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/161699).
- Supportive care:
    - Early elective intubation/ventilatory support if vital capacity <30% predicted, NIF < -30 cm H2O, or rapid progression—anticipate need for prolonged ventilation [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25817), [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/161699).
    - Monitor airway protection and initiate feeding support (e.g., NG tube or parenteral nutrition) due to dysphagia [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25815).
    - Manage secretions, provide aspiration precautions [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25815).
- Avoid aminoglycosides, neuromuscular-blocking agents, or magnesium sulfate as they worsen neuromuscular blockade [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25817).
- Deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pressure ulcer prophylaxis due to immobility [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/161699).
- Monitor for and treat secondary infections and complications of prolonged ICU stay [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/161699).

**Referrals:**
- Urgent neurology consult: Confirmation of diagnosis, neurophysiological testing if required, management oversight [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25815), [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25817).
- Infectious disease/public health: For case reporting, epidemiological tracking, antitoxin release, and food investigation [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25817).

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Patient and family education regarding safe food handling and the avoidance of home-preserved foods unless proper technique is confirmed [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25817).
- Information on signs of recurrence or persistent weakness; consideration of rehabilitation referral post-ICU for neuromuscular sequelae [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/161699).

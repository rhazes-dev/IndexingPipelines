## Summary
- 68-year-old woman with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes presents with weight loss and painless jaundice.
- Exam: palpable, non-tender gallbladder (Courvoisierâ€™s sign).
- Biochemistry: cholestatic LFTs.
- CT abdomen pending.
- High suspicion of malignant biliary obstruction such as pancreatic head cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, or periampullary tumor, pending imaging.

## Problems and Assessments

1. (Possible) Malignant Biliary Obstruction
   - Painless jaundice with palpable gallbladder suggests a high likelihood of malignant obstruction, most commonly pancreatic head cancer, cholangiocarcinoma, or periampullary tumor [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/99689), [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18277), [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17482).
   - Weight loss and cholestatic LFTs reinforce suspicion for a malignant etiology.

2. Obstructive Jaundice and Associated Complications
   - Evidence of biliary obstruction (jaundice, LFT changes) raises risk for pruritus, steatorrhea, malabsorption, cholangitis, and hepatic dysfunction [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18277).

3. Poorly Controlled Type 2 Diabetes
   - Longstanding and uncontrolled, a relevant comorbidity for perioperative and general management.

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- Complete CT Abdomen (currently in progress): To identify the level, cause, and extent of biliary obstruction, and screen for resectability or metastases [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18277).
- Consider MRCP: Non-invasive delineation of the biliary and pancreatic ductal anatomy, further characterising level and cause of obstruction [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/99689).
- If mass is present, obtain tissue diagnosis:
    - EUS with FNAB or ERCP with brushings/cytology depending on location and accessibility, to confirm malignancy and guide further management [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18277).
- Full LFT, INR, albumin, renal profile: Assess hepatic synthetic function prior to potential intervention [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/99689).
- CA19-9 and CEA tumour markers: May assist in diagnosis and prognosis for malignancy, but are not diagnostic [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/99689).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- If cholangitis or sepsis develops: Urgent IV antibiotics and supportive care, with prompt biliary decompression if indicated [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18277).
- For symptomatic biliary obstruction (pruritus, cholestasis, or impending hepatic dysfunction):
    - Endoscopic stent placement (via ERCP) for drainage if resectable or for palliation if unresectable [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18277).
    - Percutaneous transhepatic biliary drainage considered if endoscopic approach is not feasible [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18277).
- Evaluate for surgical resection if mass is localized and there is no metastatic disease:
    - Whipple procedure (pancreaticoduodenectomy) for pancreatic head or ampullary tumors if appropriate [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18277), [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17482).
    - Oncologic assessment for chemotherapy/radiotherapy if unresectable or metastatic [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18277), [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17482).
- Supportive measures:
    - Manage pruritus (e.g., cholestyramine for symptomatic relief) [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18277).
    - Fat-soluble vitamin supplementation (A, D, E, K) if evidence of malabsorption [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18277).
    - Optimize glycaemic control in view of diabetes.
    - Nutritional support for weight loss and cachexia.

**Referrals:**
- Gastroenterology and/or HPB (hepatopancreatobiliary) surgery multidisciplinary team for diagnostic confirmation, preoperative workup, and determination of resectability [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17482).
- Oncology for assessment of need for palliative chemotherapy/radiotherapy if unresectable malignancy.
- Endoscopy service for diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP as appropriate [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18277).

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Encourage smoking and alcohol cessation to reduce further hepatic/pancreatic insult and optimize general health pre-intervention.
- Diabetic education and optimization (if not acutely unwell) to improve outcomes perioperatively and long-term.

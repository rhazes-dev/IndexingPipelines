## Summary
- 35-year-old woman presents with pleuritic chest pain and breathlessness after a long-haul flight.
- Exam: Anxious, tachycardic (HR 112), hypoxic (SpO₂ 90%), tachypneic (RR 22).
- Investigations: Clear CXR, elevated D-dimer, ECG shows sinus tachycardia.
- High risk for acute pulmonary embolism (PE) given recent long-haul travel, hypoxia, tachycardia, and pleuritic chest pain.

## Problems and Assessments

1. (Possible) Acute Pulmonary Embolism (PE)
   - Strong suspicion for acute PE based on risk factors (recent immobility), clinical presentation (pleuritic chest pain, breathlessness, hypoxia, sinus tachycardia), and elevated D-dimer. Absence of alternate diagnosis on CXR. Requires urgent diagnostic confirmation and treatment due to risk of morbidity/mortality [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19382).

2. Hypoxia
   - SpO₂ 90% suggests significant gas exchange impairment. PE can cause V/Q mismatch and arterial hypoxemia; prompt oxygenation is critical [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19382).

3. Anxiety (secondary)
   - Likely secondary to the acute cardiopulmonary event and hypoxia; management may be supportive, focusing first on underlying cause.

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- CT pulmonary angiogram (CTPA) ASAP as the best confirmatory test for PE [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19382).
- If CTPA contraindicated or not available, consider a ventilation/perfusion (V/Q) scan, especially if pre-test probability remains high [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19382).
- Troponin and BNP to risk-stratify and assess for RV strain if PE is confirmed [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19382).
- Baseline bloods: FBC, U&Es, LFTs, coagulation screen prior to anticoagulation.

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Initiate supplemental oxygen to maintain SpO₂ >94% [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19382).
- Commence therapeutic anticoagulation immediately if no contraindications (LMWH such as enoxaparin, or IV unfractionated heparin if concerns about bleeding or need for rapid reversal) [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19382).
- In hemodynamically unstable patients (not specified here, but if develops): consider thrombolysis with alteplase or other approved agents [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19382).
- Monitor for complications: continuous cardiac monitoring for arrhythmias; monitor for signs of hemodynamic instability [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20023).
- Pain control with paracetamol (acetaminophen) as needed; avoid NSAIDs due to potential bleeding risk.
- Avoid empiric therapy for acute coronary syndrome unless there is clear clinical suspicion (no evidence for myocardial infarction; instead, management here should be focused on PE) [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19382).
- Mobilization as tolerated once stabilized and PE confirmed to prevent further thrombotic events.

**Referrals:**
- Urgent referral to respiratory and acute medical team for diagnostic workup and ongoing management.
- Involve hematology acutely if concerns around anticoagulation or for advice regarding duration or special circumstances (e.g., unprovoked VTE, thrombophilia, pregnancy).

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Discuss long-term VTE prevention: avoid prolonged immobility, maintain hydration, routine use of compression stockings for future long-haul travel if not contraindicated [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/19382).
- Smoking cessation if applicable; weight management and regular exercise [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20023).
- Educate regarding recognition of VTE symptoms and the need for early presentation if recurrence is suspected.

## Summary
- 62-year-old man with cough, haemoptysis, weight loss, arthralgia, saddle-nose deformity, purpuric rash, cavitating lung lesions on CXR, and impaired renal function (creatinine 180).
- This is highly suggestive of Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA, formerly Wegener's granulomatosis), an ANCA-associated vasculitis affecting the upper and lower respiratory tract and kidneys, commonly associated with PR3-ANCA positivity and frequent renal and pulmonary involvement[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).

## Problems and Assessments

1. Granulomatosis with Polyangiitis (GPA) (Possible)
   - The constellation of findings—upper airway (saddle-nose), pulmonary (cavitating lesions, haemoptysis), skin (purpura), constitutional symptoms, renal involvement (acute kidney injury)—is classic for GPA[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).
   - Urgent diagnosis is needed given the risk of rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis and pulmonary hemorrhage.

2. Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis (RPGN) / Acute kidney injury
   - Raised creatinine (180) and systemic features likely reflect RPGN secondary to vasculitis, requiring immediate action to prevent irreversible renal damage[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).
   
3. Pulmonary vasculitis/Alveolar hemorrhage (Possible)
   - Haemoptysis and cavitating lesions suggest severe pulmonary involvement, which can be life-threatening[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).
   
4. Cutaneous vasculitis
   - Purpuric rash and possible skin involvement are typical of systemic vasculitis[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).
   
5. Systemic inflammatory syndrome
   - Constitutional symptoms (weight loss, arthralgia) indicate significant systemic inflammation.

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- Urgent ANCA serology (PR3/c-ANCA and MPO/p-ANCA): To confirm diagnosis of ANCA-associated vasculitis, especially GPA[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).
- Basic labs: Full blood count, renal panel, urinalysis (look for active urinary sediment: hematuria, proteinuria, RBC casts)[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).
- Autoantibody panel: Include anti-GBM antibodies to exclude overlap/dual antibody disease[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).
- Imaging: CT chest if not yet done—characterise cavitating lesions, exclude infection/malignancy, assess severity[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).
- Tissue biopsy (preferably lung or kidney): For definitive diagnosis and exclusion of infection. Lung: evidence of vasculitis, necrotising granulomas. Kidney: crescentic glomerulonephritis with paucity of immune deposits[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).
- Urine cultures, blood cultures and infectious screen: To exclude differential diagnoses for cavitary lung lesions and haemoptysis[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).
- Additional tests: Consider viral hepatitis, HIV serology if clinically indicated.

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Immediate induction immunosuppression: High-dose IV methylprednisolone for 3 days (e.g., 500–1000 mg/day) followed by oral prednisone (1 mg/kg/day)[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).
- Cyclophosphamide (IV or oral) or rituximab for remission induction: Both are first-line options based on severity, comorbidities, and patient suitability[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).
- Plasmapheresis: Consider if there is severe alveolar hemorrhage, rapidly progressive renal failure, or dual antibody (anti-GBM+) disease[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).
- Supportive therapy: Control hypertension, monitor fluid status, renal dosing for medications, VTE prophylaxis unless contraindicated[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).
- Treat and monitor for infections: Immunosuppressive therapy increases risk for opportunistic infections—give PJP prophylaxis (e.g., co-trimoxazole) when on cyclophosphamide or high-dose steroids[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).
- Manage complications: Consider dialysis if there is severe renal failure; transfusion if severe anemia from pulmonary hemorrhage[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).

- Respiratory/Chest physician: For management of pulmonary lesions, haemoptysis, bronchoscopy if indicated[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Smoking cessation: Smoking predisposes to vasculitic syndromes and worsens pulmonary hemorrhage risk[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).
- Vaccination: Immunise against influenza and pneumococcus prior to immunosuppression where possible[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).
- Education and close follow-up: Warn about infection risks and monitor side effects of immunosuppressive therapies[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/32717).

## Summary
- 28-year-old woman with acute onset diplopia, dysphagia, bilateral descending symmetrical flaccid paralysis, bilateral ptosis, fixed dilated pupils, and areflexia.
- No sensory loss or fever.
- Recent ingestion of homemade preserved vegetables.
- Examination: signs of cranial nerve involvement without altered consciousness or hemodynamic instability.
- Key findings and food history are clinically diagnostic for foodborne botulism with high risk for respiratory failure.

## Problems and Assessments

1. Foodborne botulism
   - Consistent descending paralysis beginning with cranial nerves, autonomic involvement (fixed, dilated pupils), areflexia, and absence of sensory deficits; classic after consuming preserved foods [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25815), [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25817), [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18469).
   
2. Impending respiratory failure (Possible)
   - High risk due to progressive bulbar and neuromuscular respiratory muscle involvement; botulism can rapidly cause diaphragmatic paralysis and subsequent hypoventilation/intubation requirement [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25817), [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18469).

3. Dysautonomia
   - Manifested by fixed, dilated pupils, and possible risk of constipation, urinary retention, and cardiovascular instability in severe cases [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18469).

4. Risk of secondary complications
   - Aspiration, nosocomial infections, prolonged immobility, and need for supportive care/monitoring, especially if ventilation required [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18469).

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- Clinical diagnosis should take priority—high suspicion from history and examination justifies immediate therapy while awaiting confirmatory studies [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18469).
- Laboratory diagnosis: Send serum, stool, and gastric aspirate for botulinum toxin assay and culture (to confirm diagnosis and guide public health response, but do not delay therapy) [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25817).
- Electrophysiological studies (EMG/nerve conduction): Can support diagnosis if uncertainty exists—look for characteristic small motor amplitudes, post-tetanic facilitation—but not required to start treatment [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18469).
- Arterial blood gases (ABG) and spirometry (FVC, NIF): Serial assessment for signs of early respiratory compromise [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18469).
- Routine hematology, chemistry, and infection markers (to monitor complications and exclude alternative diagnoses).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Immediate administration of botulinum antitoxin (equine-derived trivalent or heptavalent antitoxin): Antitoxin should be administered as early as possible—do not wait for lab confirmation, as early therapy reduces morbidity and mortality [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25817), [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18469).
    - Dose and type according to national/regional guidelines.
- Admit to monitored setting (ideally ICU/high-dependency unit) for continuous respiratory and neurological observation [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18469).
- Early consideration for elective intubation and mechanical ventilation if evidence of respiratory insufficiency (decreased FVC, NIF, bulbar dysfunction, worsening weakness) [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18469).
- Supportive care: 
    - Nasogastric feeding if dysphagia severe; aspiration precautions; regular turning and skin care to prevent pressure injuries.
    - Monitor for and treat autonomic dysfunction (e.g., manage constipation, monitor urine output and retention, hemodynamic instability as appropriate) [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18469).
    - DVT prophylaxis, infection prevention and aggressive chest physiotherapy if ventilated [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18469).
- Antibiotics are generally not indicated for foodborne botulism; avoid aminoglycosides and neuromuscular blockers as they worsen neuromuscular blockade [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25817).

**Referrals:**
- Immediate referral to intensive care/critical care (ICU/HDU) for airway and neurological monitoring [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/18469).
- Notification of public health authorities for investigation and prevention of secondary cases [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25817).

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Counsel patient and close contacts about avoidance of improperly preserved foods.
- Education on early symptoms of botulism for community outbreaks and the importance of prompt medical attention.

## Summary
- 24-year-old woman with 1 month of fatigue, pallor, and exertional dyspnoea.
- History of heavy, prolonged menstrual bleeding (7 days per cycle).
- Exam: conjunctival pallor.
- Labs: Hb 7.5 g/dL, MCV 70 fL, ferritin very low.
- Smear: hypochromic microcytic red cells.
- Impression: severe iron deficiency anaemia secondary to menorrhagia.

## Problems and Assessments

1. Iron Deficiency Anaemia Secondary to Menorrhagia
   - Severe symptomatic anaemia (Hb 7.5), hypochromic microcytic indices, low ferritin, with heavy menstrual losses as clear etiology.
2. Ongoing Heavy Menstrual Bleeding
   - Major contributor to iron loss and anaemia recurrence; needs evaluation and management.
3. Fatigue, Shortness of Breath, and Reduced Functional Capacity
   - Direct manifestation of severe anaemia affecting quality of life and daily activities.

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- Pelvic US and/or gynaecological assessment to evaluate the cause of heavy menstrual bleeding (e.g., structural lesions, fibroids, polyps, coagulopathy)[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17527).
- Iron studies if not already complete: serum iron, transferrin saturation, total iron binding capacity (TIBC) to confirm and monitor iron deficiency[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25104).
- CBC monitoring every 2-4 weeks during treatment to assess response[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17532).
- Exclude additional causes of anaemia if clinical suspicion exists (e.g., screening for GI blood loss if menorrhagia not fully explanatory).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Oral iron therapy: initiate with ferrous sulfate 325 mg PO TID (or maximum tolerated dose) as first-line; titrate up to minimise GI side effects[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25104).
    - Continue at least 2-3 months after normalisation of Hb to replenish iron stores[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25104).
    - Parenteral iron (IV) if oral iron is not tolerated, absorption is impaired, or if rapid repletion is required[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25104).
- Blood transfusion only if patient is haemodynamically unstable, has symptomatic severe anaemia unresponsive to or cannot tolerate iron, or cardiac decompensation; otherwise, avoid routine transfusion[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/25104).
- Address and manage the underlying cause of menorrhagia (see referral below).
- Dietary advice: encourage iron-rich foods (red meat, leafy greens, legumes), vitamin C to enhance absorption, avoid tea/coffee with iron doses[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17532).

**Referrals:**
- Gynaecology to assess and manage menorrhagia (diagnosis, medical or procedural interventions to reduce menstrual losses)[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17527).
- Consider haematology referral if unclear aetiology, poor response to iron replacement, or suspicion for non-gynaecological cause of anaemia[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17532).

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Educate on importance of treatment adherence and dietary iron intake[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17532).
- Counsel regarding monitoring for recurrent symptoms and the need for regular follow-up in women of childbearing age[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17532).

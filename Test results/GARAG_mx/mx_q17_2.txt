## Summary
- 57-year-old woman with fatigue, postural dizziness, salt craving, abdominal discomfort, marked hyperpigmentation, and hypotension (BP 85/50).
- Laboratory findings: hyponatraemia (Na⁺ 122), hyperkalaemia (K⁺ 5.8), hypoglycaemia (glucose 3.1).
- Early morning cortisol low; ACTH markedly elevated.
- Clinical features and labs suggest primary adrenal insufficiency (Addison disease) with current acute decompensation (Addisonian crisis).

## Problems and Assessments

1. Acute Adrenal Crisis (Addisonian Crisis)
   - Life-threatening emergency with severe hypotension, hypoglycaemia, hyponatraemia, hyperkalaemia, fatigue, and confusion. Immediate management required to prevent morbidity and mortality [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17183).

2. Primary Adrenal Insufficiency (Addison Disease)
   - Ongoing autoimmune destruction of adrenal cortex causing deficiencies in both glucocorticoids (cortisol) and mineralocorticoids (aldosterone), leading to chronic symptoms and biochemical derangements [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17183).

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- Plasma renin and aldosterone: Assess degree of mineralocorticoid deficiency and guide replacement therapy [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17183).
- Urea and creatinine: Evaluate for dehydration/renal impairment due to hypovolaemia [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17183).
- FBC, CRP, blood cultures: Assess for infection; acute crisis may be triggered by infection or other stressors [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17183).
- Repeat cortisol and ACTH, if diagnosis uncertain after stabilisation [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17183).
- ECG: Monitor for arrhythmias due to hyperkalaemia [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17183).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Immediate IV hydrocortisone (Solu-Cortef), 100 mg IV bolus, then 50–100 mg IV/IM every 6 hours. No delay for test results [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17183).
- Large-volume IV 0.9% sodium chloride (normal saline) for hypovolaemia and hyponatraemia; add dextrose if hypoglycaemia persists [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17183).
- Correct hyperkalaemia if severe or arrhythmias present (calcium gluconate, insulin/glucose, beta-agonist, as per ACLS protocol) [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17183).
- Monitor blood glucose, electrolytes, fluid balance, and vital signs closely [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17183).
- Mineralocorticoid (fludrocortisone) replacement can be initiated after patient stabilises and is taking orally, aiming to maintain sodium, potassium, and hydration; omitted in the acute phase due to sufficient mineralocorticoid effect from high-dose hydrocortisone [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17183).
- Treat any identified infections or precipitating causes empirically with antibiotics while awaiting results if infection is suspected [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17183).
- Long-term, initiate maintenance dosing of oral hydrocortisone (split dose aiming to mimic circadian rhythm) and lifelong fludrocortisone [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17183).

**Referrals:**
- Endocrinology for ongoing management, education regarding lifelong steroid replacement, sick-day rules, and assessment for autoimmune polyglandular syndromes [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17183).

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Education regarding lifelong need for steroid replacement, recognition of adrenal crisis, and the 'steroid card/bracelet' for emergency identification [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17183).
- Sick-day rules: double or triple glucocorticoid dose during intercurrent illness or stress [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17183).
- Advise salt supplementation if persistent salt craving or hyponatraemia despite appropriate replacement [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17183).
- Screen for associated autoimmune conditions (thyroid, diabetes, B12 deficiency, etc.) as part of regular follow-up [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17183).

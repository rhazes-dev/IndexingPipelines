## Summary
- 72-year-old male with 12-month history of progressive memory impairment, repetition, object misplacement, and getting lost in familiar places.
- Impairment of daily activities (instrumental ADLs).
- Exam unremarkable.
- MRI: bilateral hippocampal atrophy.
- Blood tests (B12, folate, TFTs, calcium) normal.
- Clinical picture consistent with probable Alzheimer’s disease (AD).

----

## Problems and Assessments

1. Alzheimer’s disease (probable)
   - Gradual onset and progression of memory difficulties, executive dysfunction, and loss of independence.
   - Neuroimaging with hippocampal atrophy supports diagnosis.
   - Secondary and reversible causes excluded by lab workup [1](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/nursingarticle/20337).

2. Loss of independence/safety concerns
   - Difficulties with daily activities and getting lost raise concerns regarding safety and capacity for self-care [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20337).

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- Cognitive screening assessment, e.g., MMSE or MoCA, to quantify baseline cognitive deficits and track progression [1](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/nursingarticle/20337).
- Functional assessment to determine level of impairment and care needs [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20337).
- Consider formal neuropsychological testing if diagnosis remains uncertain or for baseline documentation [1](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/nursingarticle/20337).
- Assess for potential safety risks (e.g., driving, wandering), and evaluate need for home safety measures [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20337).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Initiate cholinesterase inhibitor therapy (e.g., donepezil, rivastigmine, or galantamine) as first-line for cognitive symptoms, barring contraindications (evidence for modest benefit in AD) [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17423).
- Consider memantine as adjunct in moderate to severe disease or if intolerant to cholinesterase inhibitors [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17423).
- Address non-cognitive symptoms (e.g., sleep disturbance, agitation) with non-pharmacological approaches; pharmacologic therapy only if distressing and non-pharmacological strategies fail [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17423).
- Encourage regular aerobic physical activity, which may slow progression of cognitive decline [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17423).
- Provide caregiver education and support about disease course, management of behavioral issues, and accessing community resources [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20337).
- Review medications and eliminate agents with anticholinergic properties or those causing sedation that may worsen cognition [1](https://www.statpearls.com/articlelibrary/nursingarticle/20337).

**Referrals:**
- Refer to specialist memory clinic or geriatric psychiatry for diagnostic confirmation, management advice, and advanced care planning.
- Occupational therapy for cognitive rehabilitation, ADL support, and home safety assessment.
- Social services for assessment of support at home, carer needs, and eligibility for assistive services [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20337).

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Counsel on home modifications to reduce fall/wandering risk.
- Advise advance care planning discussions early in disease course.
- Support maintenance of social activity and engagement in mentally stimulating activities [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17423).

## Summary
- 40-year-old man with 3 days of progressive symmetric bilateral leg weakness.
- Preceded by diarrhoea 2 weeks ago (possible Campylobacter jejuni).
- Examination: areflexia, reduced tone, preserved sensation, power 3/5 in both legs, plantars downgoing.
- No mention of respiratory involvement, bulbar involvement, or autonomic instability yet.
- Features highly suggestive of Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS), likely acute inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (AIDP).

## Problems and Assessments

1. Guillain-Barré syndrome (probable AIDP subtype)
   - Rapidly progressive, symmetric, ascending weakness with areflexia, preserved sensation, preceded by GI illness fits classical GBS; areflexia and flaccid paresis are typical. Immediate risk is respiratory failure, dysautonomia, and bulbar dysfunction[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461),[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28765).
   
2. Risk of respiratory failure and autonomic instability
   - GBS can rapidly affect respiratory muscles and result in life-threatening autonomic dysfunction (arrhythmias, BP lability), so high vigilance and monitoring are essential[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).

3. Differential diagnosis of acute flaccid paralysis
   - While GBS is most likely, other mimics (acute flaccid myelitis, transverse myelitis, spinal cord lesion), must be excluded, especially as imaging/investigations not done yet[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461),[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/161699).

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- Admit to monitored setting (high-dependency or ICU) for close respiratory and autonomic monitoring given risk of rapid deterioration[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).
- Serial forced vital capacity (FVC) and negative inspiratory force (NIF) measurements: to assess for impending respiratory failure (consider intubation if FVC <20 mL/kg, NIF < -20 cmH2O)[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).
- Baseline ECG and continuous cardiac monitoring: due to risk of arrhythmias/BP lability[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).
- Nerve conduction studies/electromyography (NCS/EMG): to confirm demyelinating neuropathy and rule out alternatives[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).
- Lumbar puncture: for CSF analysis after ruling out raised intracranial pressure; classic finding is albuminocytologic dissociation (raised protein with normal WCC) but may be absent in first week; pleocytosis suggests alternative diagnosis[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).
- MRI spine with contrast: consider to exclude transverse myelitis or compressive lesions if any sensory level or atypical features[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461),[3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/161699).
- Screen for infection (stool culture, serology if appropriate): especially Campylobacter jejuni[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Initiate disease-modifying therapy urgently (do not wait for diagnostic confirmation if high index of suspicion and progressive weakness):
  - Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) 2g/kg over 5 days or plasma exchange (plasmapheresis); both are equally efficacious—choose based on availability and contraindications; do not use both simultaneously[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).
  - Steroids are NOT recommended as monotherapy or adjunct (no proven benefit)[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).
- Supportive care:
  - DVT prophylaxis with compression stockings ± anticoagulation if mobile impairment persists[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).
  - Monitor for and treat autonomic dysfunction (BP, arrhythmias)[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).
  - Meticulous skin care and pressure sore prevention[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).
  - Fluid and nutritional support as per needs and dysphagia risk assessment[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).
  - Monitor for aspiration, bowel and bladder function, and initiate supportive measures as needed[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).
  - Physiotherapy and occupational therapy input early to prevent contractures and start rehabilitation[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28765).

**Referrals:**
- Urgent neurology referral: for workup, confirmation, and management guidance including NCS/EMG and initiation of IVIG/plasma exchange[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).
- ICU referral if respiratory compromise or rapidly progressive weakness develops[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Arrange for follow-up rehabilitation and multidisciplinary team for long-term outcomes, including neurology, PT/OT, and psychosocial support after acute phase[2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28765).
- Counselling and education regarding prognosis and potential for relapse or persistent weakness[1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/22461).

## Summary
- 35-year-old woman with clinical features of Cushing syndrome: weight gain, central obesity, purple abdominal striae, hypertension, muscle weakness, irregular menstruation.
- Examination: facial plethora, proximal muscle weakness, dorsocervical fat pad.
- Labs: elevated serum cortisol not suppressible by dexamethasone suppression test, significantly elevated ACTH.
- Clinical picture supports ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome (likely Cushing disease).

## Problems and Assessments

1. Cushing disease (ACTH-dependent Cushing syndrome)
   - Classic clinical, biochemical and exam findings of hypercortisolism with elevated ACTH and failure to suppress cortisol on dexamethasone testing [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20175), [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17242), [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20047).
2. Hypertension
   - Secondary to cortisol excess, with increased mineralocorticoid activity [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20175).
3. Metabolic and reproductive derangements
   - Insulin resistance/diabetes, dyslipidemia, menstrual irregularity; common in Cushing syndrome [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17242), [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20047).
4. Increased risk of infection and impaired wound healing
   - Result of cortisol excess [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17242).
5. Osteoporosis and muscle weakness
   - Cortisol-related bone/muscle catabolism [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20047).

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- MRI pituitary with contrast: To localise a pituitary ACTH-secreting microadenoma, as this is the most common cause of ACTH-dependent Cushingâ€™s in this age group [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20175).
- Consider inferior petrosal sinus sampling (IPSS): If pituitary MRI is negative or equivocal, to differentiate pituitary versus ectopic ACTH production [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20175).
- Basic metabolic panel, fasting glucose, lipid profile: To assess for diabetes, dyslipidemia, and electrolyte disturbance [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/17242).
- DEXA scan: To evaluate for osteoporosis related to chronic hypercortisolism [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20047).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- First-line: Transsphenoidal surgical resection of pituitary adenoma if identified, as definitive treatment for Cushing disease [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20047).
- If surgery is incomplete or contraindicated:
  - Consider pituitary radiotherapy or medical therapy (e.g., steroidogenesis inhibitors such as ketoconazole, metyrapone, or osilodrostat) [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20047).
- Hypertension and metabolic complications:
  - Manage blood pressure with antihypertensives (ACE inhibitors/ARBs preferred if diabetic or proteinuric).
  - Optimise glycaemic control if needed [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20047).
  - Initiate statin if indicated for dyslipidemia.
- Prevent and treat osteoporosis:
  - Vitamin D and calcium supplementation.
  - Consider bisphosphonate therapy based on DEXA results [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20047).
- Address menstrual irregularities and provide appropriate gynaecological follow-up.

**Referrals:**
- Endocrinology: For coordination of diagnosis confirmation, surgical planning, and perioperative management [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20047).
- Neurosurgery: For assessment and surgical resection if pituitary adenoma confirmed [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/20047).
- Gynaecology: For management of menstrual irregularities and fertility issues.

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Weight loss advice and healthy diet to improve cardiovascular/metabolic risk profile.
- Smoking and alcohol cessation counselling if applicable.
- Fall risk assessment and bone protection education due to osteoporosis risk.

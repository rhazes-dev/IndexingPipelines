## Summary
- 50-year-old male with progressive dyspnea, dry cough, clubbing, and upper lobe crepitations.
- History: Long-term occupational silica (sandblasting) exposure.
- Imaging: Chest X-ray shows upper lobe fibrosis.
- Findings suggest chronic silicosis with fibrotic interstitial lung disease.

## Problems and Assessments

1. Silicosis with Upper Lobe Pulmonary Fibrosis
   - Chronic silica exposure (sandblaster), classic for silicosis.
   - Symptoms (breathlessness, dry cough), exam (clubbing, crepitations), and imaging (upper lobe fibrosis) are consistent with fibrotic interstitial lung disease due to silicosis.
   - High risk for progressive massive fibrosis, respiratory failure, increased risk of mycobacterial infection [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/29026).
2. Ongoing and Past Occupational Exposure
   - Continued silica exposure may worsen disease; must be stopped to prevent further progression [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/29026).
3. Complications of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD)
   - Includes respiratory insufficiency/failure, cor pulmonale, pulmonary hypertension, increased tuberculosis risk, malignancy [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28028).
4. Functional Impairment and Quality of Life
   - Breathlessness and reduced exercise tolerance; potential need for support, education, rehabilitation [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28028).

## Recommendations

**Diagnostic Plan:**
- High-resolution CT chest (HRCT) to confirm interstitial lung disease pattern, assess fibrosis, and exclude other pathology (e.g., malignancy, infection) [4](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28028).
- Baseline and serial pulmonary function tests (spirometry, lung volumes, DLCO) to evaluate severity and monitor progression [4](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28028).
- Pulse oximetry at rest and on exertion to assess for hypoxemia [4](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28028).
- Tuberculosis screening (IGRA or Tuberculin Skin Test, sputum for AFB if indicated), as silicosis is associated with increased TB risk [1](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/29026).
- Consider testing for other complications (EKG, echocardiogram if features of pulmonary hypertension/cor pulmonale).

**Treatment and Supportive Management:**
- Immediate removal from further silica exposure; this is the only proven intervention to halt disease progression [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/29026).
- Influenza and pneumococcal vaccination to reduce risk of respiratory infection [4](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28028).
- Pulmonary rehabilitation to optimize function and quality of life [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28028).
- Supplemental oxygen if resting or exertional hypoxemia (PaO2 <55 mmHg or O2 sat â‰¤88%) develops [4](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28028).
- Smoking cessation if applicable; reduces overall pulmonary risk [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28028).
- No specific pharmacotherapy for chronic silicosis; corticosteroids reserved for acute/progressive ILD of other etiologies, not established for chronic silicosis [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/29026), [4](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28028).

**Referrals:**
- Pulmonologist/interstitial lung disease specialist clinic for diagnostic confirmation, ongoing management, and consideration of advanced therapies or clinical trials [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28028).
- Consider early lung transplant referral for progressive/refractory cases [4](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28028).

**Preventative and Lifestyle Measures:**
- Educate about strict avoidance of silica and other hazardous inhalants [2](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/29026).
- Optimize vaccinations (annual influenza, up-to-date COVID-19, pneumococcal) [4](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28028).
- Encourage regular activity as tolerated; participation in pulmonary rehab [3](https://www.statpearls.com/point-of-care/28028).
